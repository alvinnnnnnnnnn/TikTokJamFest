Just a PSA to not use the gym in this region so often to the point ur membership is converted here! Stick to other AF in the other region :-)"

I even replied confirming the fact, and yet, was sent the same exact email about payment must be made before 1st January. On top of that, next year onwards, there would be an increment of $10 but there was no prompt of it at all and it is $10 more per what i signed a year ago.

Rather than getting help on it, all i got was that I have to make payment by QR code online before 1st January or i will have the late fees incurred if I don't. I even replied confirming the fact, and yet, was sent the same exact email about payment must be made before 1st January. On top of that, next year onwards, there would be an increment of $10 but there was no prompt of it at all and it is $10 more per what i signed a year ago. This is very unprofessional and it just seems like everyone is just out to get the comms, without having the retention. Very disappointed at the customer service provided by this outlet.",

Rather than getting help on it, all i got was that I have to make payment by QR code online before 1st January or i will have the late fees incurred if I don't. I even replied confirming the fact, and yet, was sent the same exact email about payment must be made before 1st January. On top of that, next year onwards, there would be an increment of $10 but there was no prompt of it at all and it is $10 more per what i signed a year ago. This is very unprofessional and it just seems like everyone is just out to get the comms, without having the retention. Very disappointed at the customer service provided by this outlet.",

Rather than getting help on it, all i got was that I have to make payment by QR code online before 1st January or i will have the late fees incurred if I don't. I even replied confirming the fact, and yet, was sent the same exact email about payment must be made before 1st January. On top of that, next year onwards, there would be an increment of $10 but there was no prompt of it at all and it is $10 more per what i signed a year ago. This is very unprofessional and it just seems like everyone is just out to get the comms, without having the retention. Very disappointed at the customer service provided by this outlet.",

Rather than getting help on it, all i got was that I have to make payment by QR code online before 1st January or i will have the late fees incurred if I don't. I even replied confirming the fact, and yet, was sent the same exact email about payment must be made before 1st January. On top of that, next year onwards, there would be an increment of $10 but there was no prompt of it at all and it is $10 more per what i signed a year ago. This is very unprofessional and it just seems like everyone is just out to get the comms, without having the retention. Very disappointed at the customer service provided by this outlet.",

Rather than getting help on it, all i got was that I have to make payment by QR code online before 1st January or i will have the late fees incurred if I don't. I even replied confirming the fact, and yet, was sent the same exact email about payment must be made before 1st January. On top of that, next year onwards, there would be an increment of $10 but there was no prompt of it at all and it is $10 more per what i signed a year ago.
