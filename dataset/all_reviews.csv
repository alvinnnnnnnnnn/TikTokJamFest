Note that regardless of your circumstances, they will give the excuse that ‚Äútheir policy is consistent across all clubs‚Äù and charge you extra when pausing membership.

Just a PSA to not use the gym in this region so often to the point ur membership is converted here! Stick to other AF in the other region :-)"

Rather than getting help on it, all i got was that I have to make payment by QR code online before 1st January or i will have the late fees incurred if I don't. I even replied confirming the fact, and yet, was sent the same exact email about payment must be made before 1st January. On top of that, next year onwards, there would be an increment of $10 but there was no prompt of it at all and it is $10 more per what i signed a year ago.

Like any Anytime fitness in Singapore. Can get a little crowded though due to location.

Due to a lack of a toilet bowl or urinal in the cubicle, the shower room pretty much stinks due to members‚Äô inability to pee at the cubicles with toilet bowls. This is pretty much common in all AF with this kind of design. So do bring slippers if you plan to shower here to prevent getting some funky infection..

Otherwise is ok."

So I chose a pant, spent time in the fitting room and queuing too, only for them to tell me that there was no discount. I had to go back to the place as I thought I had read wrongly but I realised that I would not be the only one who would be confused, as their placement of pants and that Limited Offer sign can cause confusion. After our feedback to the various staffs,  they tried to reach out to the manager who in the end, did not bother coming out and attending to us which I found irresponsible.

He did not try to upsell me any components and even told me 4070TS is too much for my use case lol! He also answered my other questions patiently. Even though I texted him late at night, his replies were quick.

I paid a deposit a few hours later on Sunday morning (6 AM) and the PC was delivered the very next day on Monday. He gave me timely updates on the assembly, testing and delivery. He also helped to hook up the PC to my monitors and accessories to check if everything was good and if I had any questions.

I previously got a PC from the famous ‚ÄúA‚Äù brand and I must say the service is day and night. On top of that, the price given by Charles is very competitive (actually, it is even more affordable than the other few merchants I asked).

I have some background knowledge having built my own pc before but due to time constraints and life, decided to seek services to assemble all. So I was looking into the parts that boss recommended and I could see that he knows his stuff well. The guy was patient and quick in his response to answer my queries.

Finally, the time from confirming build to assembly to delivery was really fast, am grateful for delivering all the boxes as well promptly.

I've built and upgraded my own PCs in the last couple of decades and now with too much on my plate, decided to seek help after seeing their incredibly high feedback score on Carousell.
Since I'm already quite familiar with what needs to be done, Charles was very patient with my questions and demands, in upgrading my PC to exactly what I wanted. And this includes cloning my OS onto the new system (which is famously troublesome thanks to a certain OS software). He also offered good suggestions against my initial requirements which I verified and accepted.
Specific parts were obtained for my upgrade and to top it off, he fixed up my PC by the next day! My PC is rocking well in exactly the way I want it and I earnestly recommend their services to anyone who needs help with their PCs. üëçüëç"

He ran through couple of stress test and determined the problem is not my PC but probably one of my peripherals that is causing the issue. True enough. By process of elimination the problem was really my power strip which Charles did suggested for me to check.

And for all the trouble, he did not charge me any fee even when I insist on paying for his time.

Highly recommended for his expertise and honesty if anyone has hardware issues or need a new built for gaming or workstation."

Finally after many messages on carousell and whatsapp i settled for this beautiful beast.

What I really like from Charles is that he is honest and transparent about what parts is necessary for the purpose of the PC and will not over offer things that you do not need, he is also patient and provides quick and easy to understand answers to all your questions. He also tailors to your needs for example, I was not very into the March Promo case that was used as default so he offered me many more options for my budget, these little steps shows how professional and niche he at his job.

Saw a new stall ‚ÄúYuen Kee Dumplings‚Äù so we decided to give it a try.

There was a queue of 7 waiting to place their orders, while another maybe 5 other patrons waiting at the side for their meals to be prepared.

Got to place our orders after about 10 minutes, thereafter waited another 10 minutes for our orders to be ready.

We ordered their ‚Äúpopular‚Äù Shrimp & Crab Roe Wanton in Cantonese Style Soup. We were allowed to choose the type of soup or finishes (spicy, garlic, etc). $10.80.

Also the Chives & Pork Dumplings (like gyoza). For this we chose Viral Mixed Sauce with Chilli. $7.80.

The 10 Wantons were pretty big, wrapped with lots of shrimps and some crab roe, however I tasted like Ikura. The soup was clear and tasty. Overall quite good.

There were 9 pieces of Chives & Pork Dumplings in the other order. The sauce was something like chilli garlic sauce but not so heavy. They were sprinkled with peanut sauces. We found the flour wraps a little ‚Äúrough‚Äù; but tasted nice overall.

Prices were reasonable.

We finished our meal with our favorite Yuan Yang from the Toast Box Stall, next door."

The Food Republic on the upper floor is a food court that kinda resembles at local Hawker Food Center but with AC and more comfortable dining area. Its a walking distance from the hotels in the Orchard strip. Getting a taxi here is easy. You have the Ion Orchard Mall at the other side and the Somerset Mall on the opposite end.

The store was selling most brands from Club 21 were slashing prices up to 70- 80 percent discount. I asked to reserved a pair of shoes in the afternoon and put at the counter as I need to rush off to meet clients. As a salesperson myself, this service given to me was below standard. Club 21 is a respectable company in Singapore having this young managers with no respect to customer is very bad. When I went back to buy the shoes, I couldn‚Äôt find it, so one lady brought out the shoes and told me it‚Äôs sales item, you asked my part time to keep for you she don‚Äôt know anything , if we sold the shoes away there is nothing we can do!

First time, we had complained about a large dog being too close to the children playing there. When we called them, they didn't come out to speak to the owner about leashing their dog closer to them. Second time, we complained about playground maintenance cleaning the place with high pressure water jets who went about cleaning without informing us that they would be switching off the equipment nor did they take any precaution from ensuring the children were safe, away from the high pressure water jets. Again, the CC staff did nothing. They didn't come out to talk to the maintenance team, nor did they check in on us or the children. Horrible experience. Why work in a COMMUNITY CENTRE if you don't care about the community?"

I was at Paragon today and really needed to charge my phone and when I walked past the concierge I noticed that they had a sign stating that they offer portable chargers. When I went up to ask if I could borrow or rent one, the lady at the concierge didn't even look at me until i paused to wait for her to look up and assumed she was busy even though she already said ""hi"" while looking down. She then told me I had to pay a $50 deposit to borrow the portable charger, which I am completely fine with and understand the need for. She appeared shocked when I said I was fine with the $50 deposit so I just said it again that I was completely fine with it. She continued staring at me and just said ""$50 deposit"" which honestly confused me because she didn't ask me how I wanted to pay and didn't tell me only cash was accepted and repeated it until I asked her if only cash payment was available. I then told her that i didn't have cash and asked if card payment was available to which she replied ""there's an ATM""... I don't carry cash around and that's not her fault but I really think that for a mall like  paragon that the staff, especially at the concierge to have some sort of customer service training. I also think it would be a good idea to allow for card payment for the $50 deposit as many don't carry cash anymore especially if it is advertised at the concierge."

So I just went there but that huge lady with short hair refused me to see doc saying that their slots are all taken. Had a really bad sore throat (even drinking water was really pain) but she still refused to let me see doc. I even requested and do not mind to take the very last slot but still that nurse refused me and ask me to find other clinics which I was not able to find as they were all closed.

However, there is huge room for improvement at the counter. We were on time for appointment,  waited 10 minutes and was attended to Dr Adrian promptly. Next, was a 20-minute wait for medicine and the clinic was empty. I am an advocate of respect towards service staff and I believe this should be mutual when handling patients. We checked in every 10-minute intervals because my elderly mother is feeling unwell. For the first check, Nurse Stella who was busy, told me to take a seat and that her colleagues would attend to me when it is ready. We didn‚Äôt hear anything after 10 minutes. Before we knew it, there was a patient who walked in to purchase medicine off the shelf and he was attended to promptly by another nurse. After he collected his medicine and made his payment, we were still waiting to be called. When we checked on status again, nurse Stella got visibly irritated, spoke louder and told us that the medicine had to be reviewed by the doctor. Then, she nudged her colleague to speed up and commented loudly ‚Äúfaster, patient asked and asked‚Äù. It was as if it was deliberate. When her colleague finally ended the call, I realised the main holdup was because the name labels had yet to be pasted on the prescribed medicine. It reflects absolute inefficiency and also disrespect for patients‚Äô time. I would have understood if they were busy and explained why they needed more time. But, what I could not appreciate, was the lacklustre attitude demonstrated at the counter."

I was feeling extremely unwell as a suspected case of covid so I trudged myself to the nearest clinic (about 15 minutes walk) around my area. Went into the clinic at around 8pm feeling really sick and was told that they are fully booked, and I would need to book an appointment to see the doctor and I do understand that they might be short staffed. My vision was getting really blurry due to high fever from covid so I asked questions like whether they could recommend me a nearby clinic where I can get myself checked and some medicine as well.

However, instead of speaking nicely, one of the clinic assistants (short haired chinese lady) ""chased me"" out of the clinic and kept cutting me short. Told me that I should go and google it myself and pointed to the door while telling me to leave the clinic. Terrible service staff. Do not recommend. Don't bother performing your job if you're just going to be super rude towards patients who really needed some assistance.

The hugh dining hall was decorated with many posters of food and LED wordings on the walls, which, together with the plastic plants, seem somewhat crowded and tacky. The bar counter was too crowded with equipments and utensils, and was overshadowed by the large posters hanging over it. The decor could improve with a better interior designer.
The Food
I had the truffles olio aglio pasta with New Zealand ribeye. The pasta was perfectly cooked, with a nice degree of al-dente. The truffles oil add a hint of umami to the olive oil-based sauce, without overpowering it. The ribeye was a bit tough, probably due to the lack of marbling of the New Zealand steak, but was well cooked and not dry, attesting to the skill and care of the chef. The addition of black cavier on the steak, although did not add to the flavour, however did enhance the presentation of the dish. The restaurant was having a promotion of Japanese oysters - $1 for each raw oyster. The plump oyster tasted full of briny freshness, and was creamy in textual.
Conclusion
It is worth a visit if you are around the area."

I would like to share my recent experience at your Joon Koon outlet. The service at the workshop was very slow, with only one staff member attending to many customers. This led to long queues and a lot of waiting time.

It seems that the store is understaffed, especially during weekends when there are many customers with issues such as bike or badminton racket servicing. The slow service caused quite a frustrating experience for me, and I believe for other customers as well.

I hope Decathlon can improve the staffing and service speed at the Joon Koon workshop to provide a smoother experience for customers."

I also like that I have the option of self-service ‚Äî from signing up to entering the gym for the first time. With it open 24/7, I find comfort knowing that I have a place to go in the middle of the night.

Edited after a couple of months: I can't have enough of this gym. The space is just right ‚Äî not too big/small. And it's always clean even after months of opening! I enjoy working out here."

In order to qualify for the $6 voucher, I had to choose the ""Click and Collect"" option at the Lot 1 Uniqlo outlet.

When I later received your email stating that the item could not be collected during the promotion period, I decided to change the Click and Collect option to home delivery instead. However, the Uniqlo staff did not allow this change. This kind of inflexibility made me very frustrated, and in the end, I received nothing from this promotion.

If I had known it would be like this, I would not have joined this Uniqlo promotion at all. I am extremely disappointed."

Unfortunately, that size was too big and I went down to Jurong Point store to make an exchange the following day.

Truthfully, I was dissatisfied with the way the Supervisor there handled this issue.  He did not seem keen to provide the necessary assistance.

He checked for a while but informed me that the system wasn't updated and that there wasn't much he could do. Is it my problem that the system was not updated?

I do realize that he could have approached or made a call to other management for assistance but he failed. I asked if there was any other way for me to make an exchange and he informed me he could help to check with the other stores except that I have to travel to that particular store for the exchange but he didn't make the call. I could not believe it as I knew that some outlets would provide inter-store transfers upon request.

He also suggested exchanging for other items which I was not keen on.

Since he could not provide a further solution to this issue, I left the store but returned to him shortly as I wasn't satisfied with his ‚Äúdon't care‚Äù attitude. I showed him that the online has available pieces but he kept telling me his system was not updated.

Eventually, to avoid further dissatisfaction, I left the store feeling annoyed and furious. I know he could do something but he chose not to.

Finally, I managed to obtain the exchange from other outlets. A bad experience from this outlet.

Put in 2 stars because one of the staff at the cashier rendered his assistance before calling the supervisor to step in."

Additionally, the management needs to focus on enforcing gym rules consistently to ensure fairness among all users. For instance, despite the gym‚Äôs policy requiring proper attire, I‚Äôve noticed several instances where members were either barefoot or wearing slippers, which raises safety concerns.

To add to that, just yesterday, I saw someone using the treadmill shirtless. This not only poses a hygiene issue‚Äîwith sweat potentially spreading onto the equipment‚Äîbut also creates an uncomfortable environment. What‚Äôs more concerning is that this happened while a staff member was present, yet no action was taken.

40 days ago I paid a very high price to have a tooth fixed. After about 40 days, the filling developed a problem and it hurt when I drank cold water. So, I suspect that the material has fallen out, but of course, it could be something else, so I want to go for a review. Dr. Mok said she would remove the previous material and replace it with one that was temporary and did not guarantee results. I expressed my concern because once the medication failed, my teeth would be exposed and more damage would be done. Then,  after I refused to use this material, I asked if I could use the original material and Dr. Mok refused. So I decided not to change because, after all, no one wants to revert to a temporary, less good-looking material without taking that much risk. Dr. Mok went on to say that if I were to leave, she would have to take a photograph of my teeth to prove that there was nothing wrong with her fillings. I thought this was utterly ridiculous. If she was so adamant that there was no problem, why did she change me to a bad material in the first place? If I don't change the material, do I have to prove that her padding is fine? I felt that she was simply shirking her responsibility. She would not allow me to leave if I refused to have my photo taken because the case had to be documented. High charges + bad attitude + shirking responsibility make me very unhappy and I hope someone will pay attention to this matter."

As usual, Dr Mok is professional and gentle. I knew her in Nov, 2020, when I went to have the wisdom tooth removed. There was an extreme pain due to the pressure induced from the wisdom tooth. I expressed my suffer to the young lady in the counter, after a short check, she decided to let me in during the Dr‚Äôs break time. After x-ray, Dr Mok discussed the condition of the two visible wisdom teeth with me. Then everything went through smoothly. Blood stopped hours later. Quick recovery (2~3 days) and no pain after removing one wisdom tooth. One week later, I went for a bite wing x-ray to check risk of cavities (one-time check valid for 3 years) and had normal tooth cleaning.
The service is excellent, though the price is a little high (even with student discount). But Dr Mok and her assistant can be trusted!"

Had mild gums problems and the doctor (Dr. Mok) exaggerated them and asked me to do four sessions to finish up teeth scaling. I paid 400 dollars for the first visit and decided to cancel the rest of the appointments. It is a rip-off and I wonder why a dental clinic on the campus would only care about profit rather than the well-being of patients. I then went to another clinic and had completely different experience. The doctor told me that my gums problems are not serious at all and only advised to go back for another check in one month. Most important, I was only charged 150 dollars for the treatment! So if you must go to the campus clinic, avoid Dr Mok (she is on duty on Wednesdays). I hope she is the only one like this in the clinic. Otherwise, shame on the clinic!

A follow-up: So I gave them the benefit of doubt after they told me that they saw my review and listened to the doctor's explanations, albeit belated, for the fees and her rationale for the arrangement of the treatment. She claims that she did not my email that I sent her earlier enquiring why so many sessions were needed. Although it seems really odd that the email (which I sent through my NTU work email address) did not go to her gmail, let's just believe it is a technical problem. She also explains to me why she did not refer me to a specialist during the first visit because she thought she could handle it. All in all, she tried to explain everything to me, and yet I am not quite fully convinced to be honest. I just wish that the communication could have been done earlier and more effectively. I also hope that doctors could be more cautious and thoughtful when providing their medical advice in the future. And I encourage those who are going to seek dental service to speak for their needs and communicate immediately whenever you have doubts.
On another note, I appreciate their good attitude and desire to communicate with me."

He‚Äôs 100% an invaluable staff - never fails to put on a smile whenever interacting customers, greets incoming and outgoing customers, thanking them for their support when leaving, very respectful, attentive to diners needs and remained courteous throughout

During the lull period - he will be seen keeping the counter and tables clean and tidy, while doing so he would periodically turn to check if any customers would require his attention, check on the equipments functionality etc.

All I could say is that Zaim does not realise his true potential in what he could deliver and I sincerely hope his employer or his future employer could help him see it. Well done!!"

However, on our second and third visits, the quality noticeably declined. We ordered similar items each time: the spicy lemongrass lime fish, tofu with spinach, and Tom Yum (chicken or seafood). Unfortunately, after both recent visits, all of us developed severe sore throats, which may suggest a heavy use of MSG.

Beyond that, the flavors didn‚Äôt feel as authentic as we had hoped. The balance of spices and ingredients seemed off, and the overall experience left us disappointed.

I‚Äôve never experienced such poor customer service at a gym until I signed up here. From the very beginning, the Malay male staff who handled my registration was rude, dismissive, and seemed completely uninterested in assisting. It already felt like I was being judged just for being there.

When I tried to request a respectful termination of my membership, I was met with even worse treatment over the phone. Rara, another Malay staff member, was condescending, disrespectful, and completely lacking in basic courtesy. The way she spoke was offensive, and the attitude she displayed made it very clear that the gym has zero regard for customer service‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre not who they want to treat well.

What‚Äôs even more disappointing is how obvious it is that this gym treats people based on how they look. If you‚Äôre conventionally attractive, you‚Äôre treated with smiles and attention. If not, you‚Äôre talked down to like you don‚Äôt matter.

Even Virgin Active, a far more premium gym, didn‚Äôt treat me like this when I chose not to renew my membership. They handled it with professionalism, respect, and class‚Äîsomething this outlet clearly lacks.

Avoid this place. The management needs serious retraining, and the staff culture‚Äîespecially those mentioned‚Äîneeds to be re-evaluated. This gym is giving the Anytime Fitness brand a bad reputation."

There are 8 type of noodle cut to choose from, ranging from very thin to fat and broad.

Whats even better, you can refill your noodles unlimitedly if your order a large portion. The refilled noodles can be of any noodle cut. If you are a big eater, you definitely have the chance to try all 8 of them.

If both of you are small eaters and decided to share a big bowl, you can also refill but refill one time only.

I personally like the dry version and the chilli taste great. While the noodle came with soup, you may also separate the noodle from the soup with another bowl and season the sauce yourself using their given chilli and vinegar. Try until you got your perfect proportion.

Definitely will be back. And try their plum juice again."

Their service will make your day and make you feel really happy and treasured that you made the choice to dine with them! I must compliment their good service and work ethics!

They are also very kind. An elderly entered the store and they accommodated to their needs despite a full service and only 2 front staff. Fantastic work!"

This is my favorite place to have beer whenever I am here. Two bottles of Sapporo premium beer for $8 all in and at anytime of the day. This place is quiet after lunch hours and perfect for business discussions. It is also the place to kill time while waiting for your kids to finish classes.
Service is ok."

She was extremely patient and polite throughout, always serving with a genuine smile even though the restaurant was very busy.

What stood out most was her sincerity, she took the time to recommend dishes, advised us not to over-order since we only had four people, and made sure we felt comfortable. Despite having to walk extra rounds for customers, she never once showed frustration or a grumpy face.

Punggol Oasis's outlet is conveniently located just beside Oasis Punggol LRT stn (East Bound, 2 stops from Punggol Central). On the first storey.

I felt the consistency of the food across Tampines 1, Bugis & Punggol Oasis is pretty much the same (which is good).

However, the service here was just.. fine. It wasn't really peak dining hours. But initially I was waiting to be served a table. So I was in the queue. But wasn't attended to. So I had to walk in & get myself a table as the customer infront was just in the way.

I also find the luo han guo beverage at this outlet a little sweeter. As compared to Bugis+ 's.

After ordering the food & payment online, less than 6-7 mins, the food arrived. Impeccable speed."

What I love most is the location ‚Äî it‚Äôs right next to the park connector, so it‚Äôs the perfect spot to chill and have brunch after a morning run.

The only small downside is the indoor temperature. The staff mentioned they leave the glass door open because of people coming in and out, but I couldn‚Äôt quite understand the purpose of having a glass door then ‚Äî isn‚Äôt it meant to help keep the cool air inside? It did make the indoor area feel a little warm during my visit.

The place is spacious and cozy. Ordered the dry laksa pasta that is for the SG60.

The sauce is alittle too thick and creamy especially when I was still waiting for my friend food to arrived. And it is little more salty. If it gets cold the saltiness is more obvious. Not sure it my problem, but I cannot feel it is laksa enough, something missing.

Overall, to try something new, is not too bad, but maybe the chef can cook it alittle less salty."

We assume it would taste fresher and slightly tastier if it is so. The tacos were stuck together with the beef, cheese and some salsa. It was a mess and very hard to consume while we had to seperate each bite with so much difficulty and trouble. It would be better if the beef, cheese and salsa were given individually with the same generous portions. The tacos were so crispy but the combination made it hard to eat and made the tacos soggy. The soup was full of seafood umami and the beef was the highlight of the day. Perfectly medium rare and the meat melted in your mouth. A very example of the chef's grilling skills brought to the heights of culinary. Highly recommended for beef lovers!"

We ordered two Sapporo Lager pints (500ml each at $12). Drinks took about 10 minutes to arrive, and the service was friendly and smooth. Used PayWave with no issues.

Atmosphere was great. It wasn't crowded at that hour, and we got to sit outside where it was calm and relaxing. There was even a live band opposite singing Mandarin songs, which added a nice touch to the evening.

Pet-friendly too. Saw a few people dining outdoors with their dogs, which was nice to see.

Overall a chill spot with good vibes and solid service. On the pricier side, but I‚Äôd recommend it for a casual night out or to unwind after a long day."

My helper arrived at the clinic at 7:40 AM, ahead of your opening time at 8:30 AM, in preparation for her scheduled medical checkup. However, once the clinic opened, she was rejected for the checkup and was told she would need to return on Sunday instead.

When my helper called to inform me, she was told the reason for the rejection was that the male doctor on duty could not perform a blood draw for her, and that a female doctor would only be available on Sunday. I found this explanation puzzling, so I called the clinic myself for clarification.

Despite my attempts to understand the situation, I was only told again that the male doctor cannot take her blood, with no valid explanation provided. I even asked whether the doctor was a trainee (which could explain certain limitations), but was told he was not. I also asked whether a nurse could perform the blood draw, and was informed that the clinic does not have a nurse.

I find this situation extremely frustrating. My helper waited nearly an hour outside the clinic, only to be turned away and asked to return two days later. This feels both inefficient and inconsiderate, especially since no prior notice was given about the limitations of your staff or service.

I would appreciate it if someone could explain why this happened, and more importantly, advise where I can escalate this feedback so that other patients do not face similar experiences in the future.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope to receive a proper explanation soon."

We understand that the waiting time is long but we were ok with it, as long as we are able to get treated. The doctors are generally nice, patient and thorough when we consult them. The counter staff were ok in general. However, my recent experience in this clinic was disappointing. The counter staff was extremely rude and impatience. I politely asked a question about collection of medication (we waited for at least 20-30 mins already but still not called upon to collect) but received the following unpleasant responses:
- Wait... Can you wait? Wait for few minutes... Just wait...
- I am very busy. You just have to wait... Doctor still need to XXX
- Doctor, can you XXX, the patients are complaining already
We understand that the counter staff may be busy (by the way there are 2 counter staff). As patients/family members, we do not want to make things difficult for the staff. What we wanted from the counter staff was that our responses to be answered politely, and be respected. I sat inside the clinic and observed that this counter lady, for every question that patients asked, her responses would be very hostile and rude, and unpleasant. One patient claimed that he was asked to come down to the clinic at 10.30am, but this counter rudely responded ""No, I did not said that (x2)"". The patient left the clinic, probably feeling why he was treated that unpleasant way when he was already sick.

All in all, doctors are good, but the system in terms of registration and medication collection needs to be improved. What is more important is, the counter staff (working on 26 Dec morning), needs to work the way she responds to patients. If every patients that asked you a question and you need to be so reactive, defensive, hostile and rude, then the problem lies with herself. She is busy, the clinic is busy, but so are we. Please give us the respect that patients deserve when we visit the clinic."

This is my third time visiting this clinic. This is close to my home, so I come back here. Except for the doctor's diagnosis, everything else is very bad. The last two times I came, many people had to wait at least 2-3 hours to register. Even after seeing the doctor and waiting to get medicine, they had to wait at least 20-30 minutes. Alas, if you need to wait for a long time, you can inform the patient in advance. Today I came to see a doctor. There were only three people waiting, but I still waited for more than an hour before it was my turn to see a doctor. It's really ridiculously slow and a waste of time. Inefficient. If it wasn't close to my home and the sick leave was reasonable, I wouldn't come back."

I strongly suspect the issue originated from the mushroom bruschetta, which appeared off in taste and texture. Out of the four pieces served, I consumed three, as my family did not enjoy them, and I felt compelled to finish the plate.

By the following Monday, I had no appetite, suffered diarrhea over 20 times throughout the day, and experienced severe vomiting (7 times). I even fainted twice due to dehydration and weakness. The vomit clearly contained undigested pieces of the mushroom bruschetta. In addition, the pizza we ordered was undercooked in the center, which further raises concerns about kitchen safety standards that evening.

I am not attaching photos or medical documents to this message, but I will gladly provide all necessary evidence and medical reports if needed for further investigation.

Please take this seriously and look into what may have gone wrong with the food preparation that evening. Food safety should always be a top priority, and I hope appropriate actions will be taken to prevent this from happening to others.

Looking forward to your response.

Sincerely,"

There were many empty tables, but none that could accommodate our group size ‚Äî so we ended up waiting for a table in a restaurant that wasn‚Äôt even full.

One of the available tables had finished meals with personal belongings left behind, but the family was nowhere in sight ‚Äî they were clearly done eating and had gone to queue for a face painting event organised by the restaurant. We asked the manager if we could be seated there or if he could help move the unattended items so we could sit down.

He refused, saying there‚Äôs no time limit for diners and nothing could be done. Instead, he just told us to keep waiting, without giving any idea of when the family would return. Meanwhile, he stood from a distance, watching us and appearing smug and indifferent, offering no further help.

The lack of professionalism, flexibility, and basic courtesy was really disappointing ‚Äî especially since this place used to be much better. Sadly, it‚Äôs not somewhere I‚Äôd return to or recommend after this experience."

Knowing that this clinic have lots of bad reviews yet i came to this clinic. Why? Nearby to my house and secondly, i need to see the dr so badly.

During our first visit, we bought a double scoop ice cream cone, with dark chocolate and speculous flavours. I felt their dark chocolate flavour was rich and enjoyable and its texture was alright. However, we couldn't say the same for the speculoos that had a rough texture and seemed to be breaking apart in clumps.

On our second visit, we tried the molten lava cake set with chrysanthemum flavoured ice cream. My wife found this flavour too sweet to her liking and we weren't too impressed with the pre-made molten lava cake. It was decent but we wouldn't rave over it."

Instead, I had no choice but to wait at the clinic, as going home would have been too rushed and risked missing my turn.

I attempted to purchase medication but was met with unhelpful and poorly trained auntie staff who was unable to advise me on suitable options based on my prescription history. The lack of professionalism and competence from the clinic assistants is deeply disappointing.

I have decided not to return to this clinic and will lodge a formal complaint with the MOH and inform the area MP. Patients deserve better service and proper training for clinic staff to avoid such inconveniences."

I had the unfortunate experience of visiting this clinic twice in 2024, both times being consulted by Dr. Goh.

1.	August 2024 ‚Äì I sprained my thumb, and the pain extended to my wrist. I explained that I couldn‚Äôt move my thumb, and my wrist was in significant pain. Dr. Goh briefly examined my wrist and simply stated that it was sprained. He prescribed ointment, but the pain worsened over the next week. I later visited a polyclinic where the doctor provided a more thorough assessment, diagnosing a nerve injury in my wrist that required a steroid injection. After being referred to a hospital and receiving the injection, I recovered fully within three days.

2.	September 2024 ‚Äì I experienced heavy menstrual bleeding for two weeks. Dr. Goh advised me to take Norethisterone for 20 days to stop the flow. When I asked if it was necessary to take it for so many days, he insisted it was. He also added that I should take high blood pressure pills, despite me telling him I don‚Äôt have high blood pressure. He tested my blood pressure three times and insisted it was abnormal. I explained that I‚Äôve had low blood pressure most of my life and that the elevated reading might be due to panic after bleeding excessively. He refused to reconsider, claiming that high blood pressure pills would reduce the bleeding. When I tested my blood pressure at home, it was normal.

3.	Patient Privacy Concerns ‚Äì There‚Äôs absolutely no regard for patient privacy in this clinic. Two of the counter staff (packing medication and collecting payments) are respectful, speaking softly when dealing with patients‚Äô personal information. However, the two seated behind the counter never get up and instead shout out patients‚Äô full names, NRIC numbers, house addresses, and phone numbers for everyone to hear. During both of my visits, I witnessed them shouting at elderly patients. On one occasion, an elderly man mentioned it was his first time at the clinic, and the staff loudly responded, ‚ÄúWhy must you come here?‚Äù I also saw a middle-aged woman buying medication without her physical NRIC. Instead of proper verification, the seated staff simply asked her to recite her NRIC number and proceeded to sell the medication. Isn‚Äôt this dangerous? Why isn‚Äôt there a proper process in place? People come to the clinic unwell ‚Äì the least they deserve is respectful treatment."

They actually had signs out to tell patients when the queue is full (I highly recommend putting Chinese / Malay / Tamil signs too, at the side of the counter facing out to the door. Might help elderly patients and foreign workers who do not know English). This is already a world of difference from another clinic I shall not name, which I waited at for 30 mins yesterday only to be told to head over to the next door clinic and wait for 2.5H, because I'm not company sponsored. (They didn't even put a sign, srsly. Half the queue were not company sponsored.)

They also had special signs for people who self-tested ART positive too. Unlike yet another clinic in the area I shall not name, which claimed to do Swab tests online but turned me away in person saying 'no swab test here', APEX is legit. They understood the need when I told them I'm ART positive. They accommodated me when I asked if I could be given a queue no. for couple of hours later, despite the queue being full. Sure their phone line may be down, but their in-person service definitely benefits from that.

Service-wise, the staff were most efficient and polite, and I'm really thankful to Dr Tay, who cracked a joke when she saw how sombre I was about getting covid. The brave lady did not even bulk when I pulled down my mask, despite my fear of transmitting Covid to her. Kudos to her!

If there is one complain I do have, it would be the signage out at the front. It's good that APEX gets along so well with the Universal Dental Group that they even share similar letter fonts, but at first, I didn't dare go in thinking I might end up strapping myself in for a teeth drilling session. Now's not the time for sure, but in the future, when Covid does lighten up, hopefully the clinic will consider rebranding with different letter fonts, if not add an Upstairs and Downstairs Arrow logo alongside the different establishments."

Okay frustration aside, if the centre is low on resources they should stop testing at 4 and start the process of giving out reports. They should look at way to manage the crowd as well. Nobody likes waiting without any information."

Message from NIE said that the complusory health screening is free. However, before any screening is done, I was asked to pay $55. The staff said that they had informed NIE about the miscommunication. Payment cannot be made by VISA as their machine is down.

Procedure:
Before the health screening, we had to print out a form to fill in physically. It's quite long, detailing not just our personal medical details but also our family's medical history. During the screening, the nurse fill in another form with the test results. After that, we were ushered to a tablet station to key in everything again digitally, rendering all the hard copies redundant. The digital form is 15 pages long, and the touchscreen is not sensitive, so it took a very long time to key in those information that took a very long time to complete on hardcopy in the first place.

Privacy:
The waiting room for X-ray consists of 2 rows of chairs placed facing each other and in uncomfortably close distance. (Note that females are required to remove their bras and wear only plain T-shirts.) There's a curtain to separate the waiting room from the rest of the clinic, but once we're called for the X-ray, we'll have to go out. (Ladies, you might want to go with a jacket to cover yourself.)

Staff:
The only redeeming factor I guess is the staff. From the receptionists, to the doctors and nurses, everyone is very patient and friendly. üëç"

This one is deserving though. Everyone in there are like friends and really welcoming. I bumped into Amirah near my home couple of weeks after I signed up and she called out to me by name. Like how did she even remember my name even if she remembered my face after such a short period of time?

The gym is clean, users are mostly friendly and willing to rotate/share equipments. Love that the gym equipments are well maintained.

There's just one doctor and you have to seat under void deck to wait.

I found Dr Loke to be the most patient, caring, and skillful GP out of the 3. He really spends time to understand each condition, patients' concerns, and to share his knowledge and advice on health matters. He was also the only doctor whom I felt comfortable having my blood drawn by (unfortunately many GPs are just not good at finding veins).

Because of Dr Loke's thoroughness and him being the preferred doctor of many, it is common for the queue to be 1 hour long. It's usually fine to step away for a while after taking the queue number.

I consulted Dr Loke regularly from early 2021 till end 2023 when I moved house. The receptionists were kind and nice to me. Those who say they are snappy should remember this phrase ""do unto others as you would have them do unto you"". After visiting other GPs after I moved house, I also realized that One Medical Clinic's receptionists were the most efficient ones."

I fundamentally believe if you don't like your job you should either quit or do something about it and not vent it on the business's customers. Either the owners is oblivious to the situation or the staffs are putting up a front.

Staff wasnt patient at all when we asked about the ingredients displayed as there were no descriptions and it's our virgin visit. Asked for napkins if possible upon checkout and all 3 front staff quickly jumped on aggressively to say don't have, saw tissues at the cashier counter and asked if I could have one if not I could buy it and they said that's kitchen towels and not tissues so no. After seating down heard the staff complaining among themselves of how they haven't had their off days. I guess they are overwhelmed as they were are seating inside the counter on a toilet stool when we walked in. The place was empty tho with only 1 table of 2pax.

Food was good and super value for money as recommended by a fellow alumni. I personally feel it's underpriced for the quality.

To the owners I hope you're seeing this as you have a great business given your NTU story, and it will be a waste if you lose customers over stupid unnecessary things like this. Super great fast service business model with exceptional prices and the last key to the lock is to have basic decent human to human respect from the service staffs.

My favourite ingredients are the mock fish, corn and one other veggie or meat depending on what I feel like. I'm not going to dock points, but there are some ingredients I feel are pretty rough and just don't fit in terms of flavour and texture, like the fishcake looking tofu has a grainy feel and is almost flavourless. Other than that, choose between savoury or sweet and sour sauces to complete your bowl. Oh, and their scrambled egg is top notch, extremely creamy, soft and fluffy if you're an egg fan.

I dined in, and the experience was OK. Not too cold or hot, sometimes I guess one or two flies will make their way in due to the lack of a strong air-conditioning curtain? So one star off.

Located right next to Punggol Waterway Park, it‚Äôs got that rare combination of shopping convenience and scenic vibes ‚Äî you can literally finish a coffee and be strolling by the water in under five minutes.

The mall itself is bright, airy, and well laid out, with a good mix of retail, dining, and lifestyle options. Whether you‚Äôre here for groceries, a quick meal, or a movie, everything is within easy reach. Dining choices range from casual cafes to family restaurants, and there‚Äôs even a decent variety of dessert spots for that after-meal treat. I especially like how there are plenty of seating areas, making it easy to take a breather between shops.

What‚Äôs really nice is the way Waterway Point integrates with its surroundings ‚Äî the outdoor boardwalk and park connectors make it feel less like a concrete mall and more like part of the community. On weekends, you‚Äôll see families with kids playing in the open areas, joggers passing through, and couples taking in the riverside sunset.

All in all, it‚Äôs not just a shopping destination but a place to unwind, hang out, and enjoy the Punggol waterfront. Whether you‚Äôre here to shop, eat, or just soak in the relaxing atmosphere, Waterway Point delivers a complete day-out experience."

We sat outside luckily today's weather was quite cool.
German pork knuckle was clearly a highlight; came with mustard, chilli paste, apple sauce, black pepper sauce, and a serving of bread (baguette slices). Will order again. German pork knuckle is this standard is hard to come by although not all pieces of crackling were chewable, but this was probably the exception about one or two pieces. Most of the crackling were truly delectable. Meat did not taste as if it had been parboiled before roasting. Sauerkraut mildly sour. Order this first - takes 30 min at least before you continue with the other orders. Best to tell them to serve dishes together otherwise one or the other may be pretty filled up with the other dishes and waiting for this to be served.
Oxtail stew pretty well-flavoured 2 large pieces, quite meaty and came with a serving of rice.
Shepherd's pie - pretty good taste, portion for one.
Pork collar was pretty good, had bite and not tough. Whole baked potato.
We shared dishes trying to give everyone each a taste of everything.
Attentive and cheerful service.
Will be back, nice homely restaurant.
Table space was proportionate to the size of their plates and we felt comfortable shifting the main dishes around, even with drinks. Not squeezed.
Chairs were comfortable.
Warm and cold water dispenser was available, probably for during peak hours.
Paynow, paywave available."

Environment is also easy for conversation with some light background song.
Staff very diligent and very attentive. He will help to fill up water very frequently without needed to call for refill.
Fish & Chip is nice, batter not too thick
Australian Lamb Chop takes a while to prepare due to the nature of the dish. Has it medium rare, it came out delicious, don't have the strong smell..we like it. Chicken curry with choice or white rice or bread is also taste fresh, not spicy, easy to eat. To add on the chicken in the curry is boneless. Recommend"

A reliable kbbq place I always go to! Their bbq meat is something I always think about. Their 2-3 person set is usually enough to feed 4 moderate eaters after adding sides. Banchan is provided as well!

I ordered their chicken and pork set which was just *chefs kiss*. The pork was succulent and not too gamey! The chicken was tender and chewy. Not sure what magic they do to their meat texture here but sooo good! The variety of marinated meats also meant that it didn‚Äôt get jelat fast.

The owner was kind enough to help / teach us how to grill and have the meat correctly. Service staff was also very attentive and changed our charred grill almost after every one meat. They are all super friendly :)

This time, I ordered the samgyetang but it did not quite meet my expectations. There wasn‚Äôt enough herbal? flavour in the soup. The soup pretty much tasted like plain soup to me.

However, the kimchi pancake was pretty good! Crispy on the outside and there wasn‚Äôt excessive batter.

Do order their fried chicken!!! Sooo good! I didn‚Äôt order this time bc the portion was too much! Huuuuge! The chicken is super juicy and its juices literally will splash out as u bite into it. Comparable to pizzamaru (if uk how good theirs is)

Overall, do visit! Ps they are named don dae Bak bbq place irl~"

Unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst facial I‚Äôve ever had.

To begin with, the service fell far below the standards I anticipated for the price. I wasn‚Äôt asked to change out of my clothes, which was surprising and uncomfortable. Additionally, the facial bed had visible hair on it, raising concerns about hygiene and attention to detail.

During the treatment, the manual extraction process was extremely painful, and the therapist repeatedly complained about the condition of my skin. While I was aware my skin wasn‚Äôt in perfect shape, that‚Äôs precisely why I sought professional care. To address the issue, I even opted for an additional treatment at an extra cost of $188, hoping for better results.

However, not only did the facial fail to improve my skin, but it also left my face damaged, with small bumps that persist even after the treatment. Overall, the experience was deeply disappointing, especially given the high cost and the lack of professionalism. I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking quality skincare services. See attached for my a photo of my skin 10 hours post-treatment."

I‚Äôve heard horror stories of members who had issues cancelling their membership with other AF branches and was assured it wouldn‚Äôt happen here. I signed up for 18 months and was relatively happy throughout, the people are nice. However, when it came time to cancel my membership, they kept delaying their response and didn‚Äôt want to furnish me with the form to confirm the cancellation. I was constantly asked to go down to their gym and asked why I wanted to cancel (when I had already given my reasoning a few times both on text and in person). After much chasing I finally got the cancellation form and was assured that January will be my final billing month.

Today (1st February) my credit card was charged and I am appalled at the service of this gym. I‚Äôve reached out to their team and hope their service recovery will redeem them.

Just to be clear, AF is great if you have no intentions to leave. It‚Äôs only problematic when you try to cancel your membership. I have been highly dissatisfied with the cancellation process and communication hence the low rating."

White Cloud Cafe offers a simple and easy-to-understand menu, with prices comparable to most cafes in Singapore. One great perk for dine-in guests is their 20% discount on mains during weekdays from 10am to 5pm, which makes it even more worthwhile. They also have a student meal set at $13.50, which includes a main and a drink.

My daughter ordered the Cajun Pork Chop, which came with a generous portion of salad and mashed potatoes, and a complimentary iced Coke as part of the student meal. I went for the Baked Haddock Fish Fillet served with saut√©ed mushrooms in garlic and mashed potatoes.

Their mashed potatoes truly stole the show ‚Äî ultra smooth, creamy, and buttery. I rarely finish mashed potatoes, but I cleaned the plate this time. A close second would be the saut√©ed mushrooms, which were packed with flavour and nicely done with minced garlic.

A pleasant spot with decent food and thoughtful weekday deals ‚Äî definitely worth a try if you‚Äôre around the area!"

had chocolate and strawberry gelatos after for dessert. it was sooo goood.

The Teriyaki Chicken Pizza served was clearly a frozen base with some meat simply added on top.
Something I could have made at home with minimal effort.

For the Chicken and Waffle, the waffle tasted like it came straight from the freezer, the chicken had that dry, air-fried texture and the egg was completely bland with no seasoning at all.

The Mushroom Soup was by far the most disappointing dish. It somehow tasted worse than canned soup, with an odd bitter aftertaste that made it hard to finish. The garlic bread was just a hard piece of bread with some garlic bits sprinkled on top. No flavour, no creaminess. Nothing redeeming.

To make matters worse, the prices were on the higher end. For the quality we received, it simply felt like we were being overcharged. I honestly left feeling like I wasted my money and I believe a refund would be fair considering the poor quality of the meal.

Not a place I‚Äôll be returning to or recommending."

But today I went back to try the second time with straw berry ice creamb(3.50 a scope) and butter waffle (7.50 one piece), and it was the worst waffle I have ever ate. The waffle was not warm and crispy, I don't even understand how they can open a shop selling this quality of waffle. The strawberry ice-cream taste so so artificial and fake.. very disappointed with the quality I get with the price I have paid. By the way, it was at kampung admiralty.

Never buy waffle and strawberry ice cream at sweet reservation, if not you will regret. and I don't plan to continue patronising after this experience."

We have been patronising this cafe for a few years now. Service is excellent - staff are always polite, patient and friendly.

We love the food! Prices are reasonable and the food always tastes amazing. Fish is fresh, chicken is always well-cooked and tender. The pulled pork is well flavoured and tender too.

I would absolutely recommend coming her for a meal. My family and I will continue to be regular patrons because we enjoy the food so much :)"

üåü 9/10
üìç Ci Yuan CC
üí∞ Expected damage $15-$25

Value for money and no service charge. This place has been around for a long time and their serving is huge for their prices. My personal recommendation is their mentaiko pasta with the fried chicken. The sauce makes the pasta very savoury which goes well with the crispy chicken. Wanted to try their soft shell crab mentaiko pasta but they only serve it at the upper thompson branch.

The mentaiko Mac N' Cheese is very decadent due to the heaping amount of cheese which caters to many young cheese lovers. Fried chicken and waffle was good and a go-to for those craving a sweet and savoury meal once in a while.

The dessert - devils chocolate cake, is the icing on the cake as it was so thick and sinful. When paired with the ice cream, you are guaranteed to be seeing a doctor soon which is the job of a good dessert. Definitely recommend this place üëç"

She cried non stop when in the class and continued crying the whole night. She was very traumatised and fear going back to the class. We have stopped the class for her. We went to the doctor thrice in the past week.
The teacher didn‚Äôt even ask the parent of the culprit (a boy who is notorious in the class) to stay behind after class to speak to us. This is unacceptable.
We understand that this matter has been reported to KBCC but after one week- nobody has bothered to reach out to us to even follow up and see whether we need any assistance. Either they are too busy or such accidents happen so often that there‚Äôs no cause for alarm even when children‚Äôs eyes are injured while attending classes at this CC.
This is horrible- Attend classes at your own risks."

There is a female Indian staff member (likely a cleaner or facility attendant) who was extremely rude and aggressive throughout our session.

She was yelling at everyone in a loud and hostile tone, accusing us of placing items around the court that we didn‚Äôt even touch. Her behavior was completely uncalled for and made the environment feel tense and unwelcoming. To make things worse, she shouted at us to leave two minutes before our session officially ended, just so she could close up early. We paid for the court and expected to use it peacefully till the end, not to be rushed and yelled at.

This is supposed to be a community facility for everyone ‚Äì children, the elderly, and families ‚Äì to enjoy an active lifestyle in a safe and friendly space. Instead, we were made to feel like a nuisance.

Honestly, not a conducive or welcoming place at all if this is how patrons are treated. Proper staff training is clearly lacking here. I‚Äôll also be raising this to relevant channels because our community deserves better ‚Äì at the very least, some basic respect and professionalism from staff."

It's shocking that a community center, which is meant to help residents, has staff members like this who seem to have no interest in doing their job properly.

So what is the point of booking it in the first place.

Booking was from 8pm to 10pm. 930pm the uncle start to chase us off saying last game. We see the uncle was old and try to finish up our game ASAP but he start to say ""HELLO, I ALREADY SAY LAST BALL RIGHT?""

Didn't wanted to argue or quarrel with the uncle. We start packing up and changing our shoes but the uncle just stand at the stage waiting to turn off the lights.

I didn't mean that we are supposed to play till 10pm but I am sure the uncle attitude could have been much better. Simply say ‰∏çË¶ÅÂ∑≤ËÄÅÂçñËÄÅ. We already give our respect and understanding to you. ‰∏çË¶ÅÂíÑÂíÑÈÄº‰∫∫ and we definitely will not book the court there anymore. Thank you"

He was patient, good-mannered & not pushy. I ordered the laptop though there was no stock in the level 1 shop at SLS.

I left the shop with the receipt & about 15 minutes later, he called to inform me that he had gotten 1 set of the laptop. I didn‚Äôt ask if it was from their other store or T-loan from other shops :-)

Anyway, he bothered to call me instead of having me to make another trip on another day to collect the new laptop.

Thanks."

Let me paint a picture: I arrive, feeling unwell and seeking medical attention. The first hurdle? A nurse with the temperament of a rabid badger. Not only did she hurl my identification card TWICE, but she then proceeded to inform me that I wouldn't be seeing the doctor because, in her infinite wisdom, she couldn't find my medical histor card. Apparently, my illness was an inconvenience to her filing system and not having to pay cash to her was bad for her business? Since I was going to claim it under medical card.

Instead of offering assistance or, you know, basic customer service, she dismissively told me ‚Äú I cannot find you cannot see doctor unless you pay cash‚Äù.

My spouse and I are very grateful for the patience coaching by Founder/Coach Dhyaanesh, Coach Aziz, Coach Jay etc during our time there. Both of us didn‚Äôt have fitness background and starting the fitness journey were intimidating for us but the team of dedicated and experienced Coaches and F45‚Äôs thoughtful workout design for strength and cardio made it easy for us to follow through. It‚Äôs really fun and motivating that the classes change every 4 weeks. You never have to worry of getting bored. We were usually at the morning 7.15am and the evening 7.15pm or 8.15pm classes. We enjoyed the quietness of morning and the busyness of evening classes. The clean shower room was important for me when I attended the morning classes before work and the best part is it‚Äôs usually unoccupied.

While we decided to pause our fitness journey with F45 fitness this season due to my spouse‚Äôs work schedule, we would love to be back in near future.

Highly recommended for you if you‚Äôre on the verge of making a decision. You can try them for 2 weeks trial first.

Pro-tips :
1) Don‚Äôt stop after 1 session, push through the sessions and your aches and sores would feel less intensive. For us, we kind of recovered after 3 consecutive days of classes when our muscles adapted.

2) Do what your Coaches told you. We were often in Coach Dhyaanesh and Coach Jay‚Äôs classes, they were really helpful to correct us or show us modified workout when they saw us struggling.

3) Ask the Coaches if you‚Äôre sure. During one of the busy classes, I remember feeling unsure how I should hold the weight and I was glad I asked Coach Aziz. It was important for me I picked up the right habits.

4) Go slow and focus on form when you‚Äôre new. We are glad we learnt our foundation from them.

Thank you, Coach Dhyaanesh and F45 Jurong West!

Oh yah, there‚Äôs a Sheng Siong supermarket and a coffeeshop nearby. Very convenient!"

He is strong and consistent. Always pushing me hard and encouraging me in our sessions. The coaches as well. While they are not those hellish trainers from BMT, they do challenge you and the onus is on us to take their souls David Goggins' style and push through.

Taste wise, absolutely hit the mark - Restaurant standard. The portion is also very generous and it is rather affordable too.

Ex-restaurant chef is no joke and it is worthy of its reputation"

Had gone there at 815pm n was told last order was slightly before 9pm.

Had ordered pork n chicken katsu set that came salad n soup.  Added one side dish of 2 pieces of fried ebi.  Cost almost $33.

Rather pricy for a coffee shop set up but food is of reasonable quality.  Someone reviewed as same as Ma Maison (MM).  Really?

I tapau tonkatsu from MM in JB.  The food is still excellent after 1.5 hours of commuting back to Singapore.  Food stand for that long n still taste good.  That's quality of the food at MM southkey mid valley JB.

Only a short wait at this stall and collected my order in less than 15 mins.  Rather efficient.

Stingy in giving the brown sauce!  I was only given 2 small sauce cups!!  But paid almost $32.  Rather loop sided deal!

May return if I crave for tonkatsu n around this area or don't know what to eat.  Will not be my natural choice to go to this place as the carpark exit did not allow good visibility of cars when trying to filter to the main street."

No charge for water. There is a service tax and no GST. Polite Myanmarese wait staff.

For $29.90 you get quite a big serving of Oxtail Stew. You can either choose to have it served with rice or baguette. There were 3 pieces of fairly large ox tail, big potato chunks, carrots and whole onion. The ox tail meat was soft and came off the bone easily.

The chicken curry ($15.90) was surprisingly not oily unlike the ones you normally get served with a layer of oil floating on the surface. It did not have the cloying sweetness of a lemak curry. Strong smell of spices reminiscent of Indian curry. Decent pieces of chicken however disappointed that there was only 1 piece of potato the size of a 50 cents coin."

Then again they are running a business and the cost to rectify this problem may be high hence the reluctance to rectify it.

Located in a quiet part of the neighbourhood, Reached there just after 2pm and there were no crowds and sitting was not a problem.  We could choose our own sitting.

Cafe was quiet and tables were either studying or having group chats. place is very instragamable. It become more crowded after 3 plus.

Minimum staff interaction which was ordering at counter and being served the food only.

Ordered honey glazed wings, Hawaiian pizza and smoked salmon waffles. Drinks called are latte and hot chocolate. Food was prepared very quickly. Food tasted great and for the portion ordered is just nice. Latte could have done with more milk in my view.

I didn't experience any bad food or service and will revisit again. A last feedback is perhaps to look to change the cushions as some are very stained. Recommended."

Their excuse was that we need to come before 4pm to do so, even though the clinic closes at 9pm. However, this information was nowhere stated on their website. I even called them before going down so that I could confirm but no one answered the call. Receptionist staff were very rude as well. Many of my friends also have very bad experience with Fullerton Health, including rude and incompetent staff. So NTU if you see this, please consider changing the healthcare provider if you have the slightest care for your students wellbeing."

I only come here because it is the closest clinic to the school and it is hard for me to travel when I am sick. The doctors treat patients as if they are faking their illness. It is your job to give good treatment including good service to patients and you are PAID to do so even by those who are faking so what‚Äôs with the terrible attitude? If you do not like the job, stop working instead of being annoying to patients. I am already in a bad mood because I am unwell and coming here only makes it worse and the meds do not really help either. It will be great if all the doctors can be changed to better ones that have higher EQ and IQ."

After I received my 4th booster vaccine, the elderly staff rudely gave me the acknowledgment slip and asked me to go off in a rude manner.

I don‚Äôt know whether this staff is having a bad day at work or what but this is not the way to behave toward the patient. I even wonder if this staff is given proper training to learn how to attend to patients especially elderly patients because some of them aren't familiar with the technology.

These staff should be laid off from their job if they aren't happy with their current job because patients are paying their salaries to begin in the first place.

my overall service experience here in this clinic excluding doctor lim is horrible. To the people reading this review, if you don't want to be treated rudely please don't visit this clinic."

Even when you arrive by Google maps, you can hardly find it as it is located within the Happy hawkers food court under Block 671.
We were quite happy to find food satisfying and of excellent quality. We ordered the Ebi Fry curry rice and their signature Pork Katsu rice set. The Pork Katsu aka Tonkatsu cutlet was fried extra crispy on the outside, but exquisitely juicy amd tender on the side (see photo). It is comparable to those served at Ma Maison outlets, if not better! The miso soup and the cabbage salad topped with Japanese sesame dressing complemented the tonkatsu very well.
I hope Maruhachi will maintain their quality, especially at this outlet. Our meal was super satisfying!"

Received a email from suntec+ team on 13th Aug that they will be requesting BANK CARD TRANSACTION STATEMENT on 6 Aug from me to prove that the transactions made on that day will made by me. Out of 11 transactions, 9 was charged to my card while the other 2 transaction, which i was unable to provide, as they were made by my companions, who went out with me.

Spent $20k within a year in Suntec but in the end was received this type of treatment. Really disappointed with their team. I hope the 'sudden investigation' were conducted to every Suntec member and not just to a selected/targeted ""members"". (Maybe i got $400+ worth of points)

On 16 Aug, received another email from Suntec team that my account has been cancelled due to ""i earn points using relatives/friends purchases WITHOUT WARNING.

Over 4,5 staffs we often see around the floor and none of them able to greet customers properly, serve food to customers just bring to the table and place it on, even when they clear the empty plates they can‚Äôt even greet or ask for permission if we wish to have it clear, they come and go just silent like the robot.

Tried a variety of dishes for dinner. They have a good spread of options, and the flavours striking in a way that speaks to their authenticity while being affordable.

Their dishes were great. The standout was the steamed sea bass, the fish was fresh, the texture was delicate but robust. Their vegetables were well seasoned, with stir fried beans crisp and flavourful. The egg and tomato was a simple dish but was no less satisfying.

Their food also did not shy away in the spice area, with the heat making a balanced roundness to the dishes without being overpowering. For those not well acquainted with spice, I‚Äôm sure they are amenable to requests to taper the kick. Though I do recommend it for the experience.

Service was prompt and attentive, complementing the dishes served. Would come again. They also have private rooms with KTV systems."

It's a simple question, is the pitch free to play or is it by booking?  However was merely out on hold instead. It's frustrating as the pitch was opened weeks ago then locked up again, citing works to be done. Pitch looks fine, was told by contractors that works are completed and keys was hand over to cc/ tc but now any enquiries are merely brushed aside.

I am Regular Uniqlo customer for many years
Membership ID: 7081012775257
Purchased quite many years already ..

On July 5 accidentally bought wrong size
And came back today 12/7/25 @6pm
@ UNIQLO WATERWAY POINT for exchange
Customer service personnel wasn‚Äôt helpful at all
At first some junior attended me and and then she called her senior who ,
deliberately denied exchange for the price  tag (pic attached) since it came out of the product..

She is. Saying
‚ÄúThis is not considered ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù since the price tag came off ‚Äò
I was like
Wow , it‚Äôs just attached with a hair like thickness
plastic tie , how I am supposed to keep it intact if I able to find time and come after a week ?!!!

The product to be exchanged was untouched and new

First time regretting my purchase and experience at Uniqlo

Hereafter will refrain from buying here and time to
Move on to H&M and other standard customer centered brands"

‚Ä¢ Customer Service: 5/5 (Exceptional service from Shyaf and Azrinah, especially Azrinah's patience and style advice)

‚Ä¢ Store Ambience: 4/5 (Well-organized and easy to navigate)

Overall: 5/5

I recently visited the Uniqlo store at Waterway Point (83 Punggol Central, #01-21, Singapore 828761) and had a fantastic shopping experience. I was particularly pleased with the selection of Heattech items. I picked up a navy blue Heattech Cotton Crew Neck T-Shirt, an off-white Heattech Cotton Crew Neck T-Shirt, and a pair of black Washable Knit Ribbed Pants (Co-ord) (Regular Length).  The quality of the Heattech is, as always, excellent, and the pants are incredibly comfortable.

The service I received from Shyaf and Azrinah was exceptional. Azrinah was especially patient and helpful, offering valuable style advice as I tried on different items.  Her assistance made my shopping experience much more enjoyable.

The store is well-organized and easy to navigate. I highly recommend this Uniqlo location for its great products and outstanding customer service. I'll definitely be back!"

I've been patronizing the store regularly, but today I really not being appreciated as loyal customer.
I bought a NON-discounted shirt for husband, paid at kiosk and registered my purchase in Uniqlo app. I did print the receipt, somehow I lost it somewhere, I do admit my mistake.
Just unfortunate I bought the wrong size and need to exchange it to smaller one, so back to the store.
To my surprise the guy simply reject my request, although he able to extract my receipt referring to my Uniqlo's app purchase history.
Told him I only asked to exchange size, not returning/refund, or exchange model. Eventhough the receipt was shown in his device but still he didn't even care how I explained it, he simply said it is system requires to have the original receipt.
It just too bad even supervisor no longer using human sense for customer relationship, simply dictated by system is all the guy can do. Not even offering help to further check with store's higher authority personnel.
So I decided to forget about this lame brand :)"

I ordered some lemon tea and egg and waffles for breakfast and the lemon tea was sour BUT there was sugar syrup so I could make it sweet which is how I like it. The egg and waffles however were amazing. The egg was the weakest part but it was still rich and tasty, the waffles however were amazingly crunchy and the honey they provided supplemented this fact more. The cherry on top was the crunchy greens which were just nice with the sauce they used. The workers were cool and the place was well air conditioned and well cleaned with a toilet to add. In conclusion, amazing place, would come back for more."

While me, my son and my sister were dining in to try their breakfast menu, my son accidentally broke the table‚Äôs QR code. I informed and offered to pay for the damage when the lady (i assumed was the owner) served our food. However, HALFWAY through our meal, she accused my son of breaking it again, saying that her staff recognized my son and that he already broke it before which is untrue, as we hadn‚Äôt visited in over a month and QR codes weren‚Äôt even used then.

She insisted it was him despite our explanation, and gave a rude ‚Äúwarning‚Äù not to let it happen again. She also said the boy who broke it was at the outdoor seating, with only my son and my husband around. I asked my husband and he said there had been no such incident. She even told us that she would like us to visit again, so although he ‚Äúbroke‚Äù twice, we should be more vigilant. The way she gave a smirk, and insisted in her mind that it was my son without checking the cctv or to show any evidence made me extremely furious. When the owner left, I confronted the staff, she mentioned the incident she referred to happened INDOORS, and that clearly telling us that it wasn‚Äôt my son as our last visit, they haven‚Äôt introduced the QR code yet. The staff immediately apologized. She was helpful, and very apologetic and I was very thankful of that.

Being falsely accused like that, especially mid-meal, was upsetting and unprofessional. I didn‚Äôt even get to finish the food as I had no appetite after we got falsely accused. We definitely won‚Äôt be returning. Please review your evidence before making such accusations."

Upon ordering, drinks came after 10 mins of waiting. The beef ragu took ard 20 mins. And the Steak and Fries took a whopping 30 MINS WOW. Even more wonderful that it was thin and not flavourful. We had to flag down the waiter to ask for the brownie dessert but he kept ignoring us üòç took abt 10 tries to get his attention, and in the end, another waiter helped get the brownie for us.

Notes on the dishes:
Steak was thin. The sambal served with the steak was odd. It was weird with the sourdough and it was weird with the steak. Didn't know what to do with it. Beef ragu was okay. Drinks were okay. Brownie was about the size of my palm.

Total bill came to more than $90. Anna's Beef Ragu ($28), Hibiscus Bliss Frizz ($7), Orange Lychee Cooler ($8), Anna's Steak and Fries (medium, $28), Mochi Brownie with Sea Salt and Olive Oil (serve later, $6.33)

Deeply concern & disappointed towards their poor quality of utensils used. The bowl used for my child's spaghetti from the kids meal ‚Äî was in extremely poor condition!

Look at the attached image - it was so badly scratched that I was genuinely alarmed. Scratched plastic, especially when used to serve hot food, can leach harmful chemicals into the meal. This is particularly worrying given that this bowl was clearly intended for children.

As a proud Singaporean dining in one of our most established tourist attractions, I expect caf√©s to uphold the highest standards of hygiene & safety, especially when serving meals to young children! The use of such degraded and potentially hazardous tableware is absolutely unacceptable.

Ensuring safe, clean & food-safe materials should be a non-negotiable standard for any food establishment."

The food was exceptionally bad. The chicken dumplings were deep fried and extremely oily. The chicken burger had a terribly salty patty. The strawberry banana smoothie was an artificial tasting icy monstrosity. The only thing decently edible was the calamansi juice and that too was watered down. Very disappointing.

Hits: the curry fish head, sambal lala and dual method kailan were great. cereal prawns were good too but note that it is shelled. The sauces paired well with rice.

Misses: the tom yam soup was way too salty to the point that is barely edible.

Service: food came relatively fast. Order by QR and pay at counter.

Price: Just about what I expected for zichar.

Atmosphere: the indoor seating is very well air conditioned. The outdoor seating is decently cooled by fan, and you can see cooks preparing otah. However, expect insects flying around and on the table as it is within the Park after all.

Overall, it was a decent experience for zichar, though familiarity with what's good would be ideal."

The front staff, especially Jasmine, are professional and extremely helpful. The clinic's design is thoughtful, with both an air-conditioned waiting area and a spacious open-air waiting area. This segregation is particularly considerate, as some parents may prefer not to stay in an enclosed space when their child is unwell.

I was especially impressed by an instance where I witnessed Jasmine during triage. She quickly noticed that a child had an extremely high fever and immediately checked with the parent to administer a dose of ibuprofen. Her quick action and attentiveness made all the difference.

Doctor has always been helpful, detailed and patient dealing with queries and cranky children. Medicines works as intended and so far I do not have any experience of follow-up visit because child was still unwell, thankful for that.

Nurses/counter staff, in my experience, have been great. Gentle with my girls, and kind but some doesn't look as approachable. Not an issue though.

The queueing system, however, has not changed for the past few years. Snaking queues, long waiting hours; I had to be ""kiasu"" enough to reach as early as 7:30am to ""chope"" my place just to avoid +++ waiting time. Once, we were third in line but had to make way for appointment basis visit, followed by 2 others which took more than an hour to wait (from opening time) ‚Äî with sick cranky kids it's a chore.

Previously during covid days, the nurses were quite strict on number of people waiting in the clinic (which to me was good honestly given the small space); but on my recent visit, most of the them were waiting inside. It gets a little chaotic though with all the sick, crying kids and tight space. There's some toys prepared for the kids too.

Payable by CDA. Not sure what other payment method accepted.

On better days, I get to have breakfast nearby first while waiting; the nurse will give a call when you're 3rd in line so there's ample time to head back.

I'd recommend for non urgent visits; and if you have more time to spare. Otherwise, GP/polyclinic may be a better option.

Despite all these, my number one choice will still be the GP right across my block for convenience (though we've had 2nd visit issues cause of unsuitable meds). Its much cheaper too. Hahaha."

Similar to most paediatric clinics that we've visited, KidsHealth accepts appointments and limits walk-ins. They were also very clear that the wait for walk-ins might be 1-2hrs. This was acceptable for us as we have not seen any paediatric clinics with little or no waiting required for walk-ins.

We were thankful for the coffeeshop that allowed us to wait for 2hrs with a full tummy.

During my father‚Äôs visit on 30 April, Dr. Chuang picked up on something subtle and recommended an ECG, something my father hadn‚Äôt even thought necessary at the time.

That simple, precautionary step turned out to be life-changing. The ECG revealed clogged arteries, and even the hospital doctors later remarked how lucky it was we came in when we did‚Äîjust in time to prevent what could have been a major heart attack.

We‚Äôre beyond grateful for Dr. Chuang‚Äôs sharp eye, medical intuition, and genuine concern.

Thank you, Dr. Chuang."

Clinic was run down, consultation room was messy with a lot of antique stuff. Doctor has his own medical condition and sitting on wheelchair, deemed unfit. The consultation lasted 10 minutes and less than 3 minutes were spent checking on my mum. Wasted $98 for a MC and a few medication. Highly recommend to avoid this clinic. Doctor even told us not to go at that timing because it is closing time, not good. As if we can control when we fall sick and when we have to see a doctor."

When my wife struggled with a condition for many weeks, there wasn‚Äôt anyone else I trust more to help her. We drove all the way from Hougang to Jurong West.

I trust Dr Chuang because he goes about his profession with the same beliefs I hold dear to. I am trained to uncover the root cause as an engineer, before designing a solution. As an experienced HR practitioner, I do not prescribe approaches that address symptoms. One easy but wrong way is to throw training at an employee when the harder right is to give him or her the unpleasant but truthful feedback. Few want and dare to do what‚Äôs necessary to help others.

I once asked Dr Chuang why he chose to be a GP when he is a world renowned specialist. He told me he injured his hand and could no longer be a surgeon. He is different from many doctors so many will see him as unorthodox and think he‚Äôs wrong when he‚Äôs not.

My wife got the significant and sustained treatment we were looking for. Hope you have a clearer idea of how I see Dr Chuang now."

The caf√© offers an impressive variety of affordable and reasonably priced dishes, catering to different cravings. Whether you‚Äôre in the mood for Mee Goreng, Chicken Cutlet Rice, Hongkong Mee, Hor Fun, Mui Fun, Popcorn Chicken, Yong Tau Foo, Fried Bee Hoon, or Kway Teow, there‚Äôs always something to choose from.

One of the highlights of this caf√© is its indoor air-conditioned dining area, which provides a comfortable escape from the heat. However, seating is quite limited, especially during weekday lunch hours, so it‚Äôs best to come early or be prepared for a short wait. Despite the crowd, the service is efficient, and orders are usually prepared quite fast, making it a convenient option for those on a tight schedule.

A standout for me is their sambal chili‚Äîflavorful with just the right amount of spice, enhancing many of their dishes perfectly. It‚Äôs the kind of place that serves no-frills, hearty meals, ideal for a casual and fuss-free lunch.

If you‚Äôre in the Pasir Ris area and looking for a budget-friendly, tasty, and quick meal, Richton Caf√© is definitely worth a visit!

*However do note that there is no toilet üöæ there but there is hand-wash basin at the side."

What stood out most was the professionalism and warmth of the staff ‚Äî from nurses to therapists to admin personnel. Everyone was patient, respectful, and genuinely caring in how they interacted with the patients. It gave me a lot of reassurance seeing my loved one so well looked after.

Facilities were well-maintained given its newly opened as well and visiting hours were managed smoothly. There are also great amenities - Koufu food court, POSB ATM, AXS machine, starbucks, Koi, and a pharmacy. Pretty decent for a community hospital.

A great example of community healthcare done right unlike some others i have visited. Thank you to the team at Outram Community Hospital for your dedication and compassion."

Uncle Joshua served my breakfast on 27Dec morning. He‚Äôs humorous, kind and attentive!üòç Just what patients need when they are down and in recovery- humor brings laughter! Thank you for asking if we needed more hot drinks even after we had our breakfast.

Another be-spectacled basic care assistant wasn‚Äôt that nice - the meals I would say: delicious but the serving portions are too little. So I‚Äôve asked for 2 packets of crackers and a Milo- the auntie passed by the nurse counter and said aloud: usually we don‚Äôt give right after meals you know?! Hello, not your crackers and Milo and I am the patient leh, I cannot ask for more food if I‚Äôm still hungry meh?

She did not attend to my email since Wednesday, 23/4/25. Due to the non response I emailed QSM of NTU yet my email was also unattended.

You know how hard it is to find another in the other floors beside entrance? If the patients need the wheelchair they would‚Äôve got the chair before they entered.

I visited the hospital with my grandma today and when she went in for her treatment, I waited for her outside and decided to wheel the empty wheelchair to an area with seat.

An older nurse stop me and ask that I placed the wheel chair outside. I said my grandma still wants to use the wheel chair as she‚Äôll only be inside for a short while, but she still insisted I put it outside so everyone can use.

Can you for the love of god use your head and understand the reason why it‚Äôs a dumb idea to ask patient to put wheel chair outside the hallway? There is literally no wheelchair outside especially when there is a lot of visitors. Why do you think all of us are bringing the wheelchair with us whenever we go?

If I put it outside ‚Äúfor someone to use‚Äù and they take the wheel chair, I need to go all the way to the ground floor because that‚Äôs the only place I know where to get wheel chair. If my grandmother alone came here, she put out then how? Can‚Äôt find the wheel chair and ask her go all the way first floor to get?? If my grandfather came instead, he need go all the way to the first floor. You only want young people to accompany patient is it?

Trouble another nurse to get wheelchair all the way from first floor? I‚Äôm sure they don‚Äôt exactly know where to find wheel chairs either in the other floor. It‚Äôs near impossible because I also had to find wheelchair in the other floor before.

You know I‚Äôm honestly applaud and offended, like if this was my grandmother I don‚Äôt think she even knows where to find the wheel chair after she put outside. And is it even necessary to tell us this? If you have limited wheelchairs I understand, but I visited the hospital and there are numerous wheelchairs outside the entrance ground floor. It comes off as a little too insensitive and stuck up. Also why am I the only one who was told this?? She never even tell the other older visitors who are accompanying the patient. When my mother came to me she immediately stop what she said and left?? Just because I‚Äôm a young person doesn‚Äôt mean I won‚Äôt put up a bad review or complaint."

As a medical professional myself, I can genuinely say that meeting Dr. David, my father‚Äôs oncologist at Singapore National Cancer Centre (NCCS), has been one of the most inspiring experiences in this journey.

From the very first appointment, I could see his depth of knowledge, professionalism, and compassion. His clinical judgment is exceptional ‚Äî calm, clear, and deeply reassuring. I‚Äôve learned so much just by being in the room with him during my father‚Äôs visits.

Despite being told in Dubai that my father might have a new cancer, Dr. David‚Äôs expertise helped reveal that this was not the case. His careful review and insight proved that the earlier findings were incorrect ‚Äî and for that, my entire family is deeply grateful. I‚Äôm truly happy I traveled all the way from Dubai for this opinion and treatment. It was absolutely worth it.

I also want to thank Dr. Brian, my father‚Äôs surgeon at Singapore General Hospital, for his excellent care and support throughout this process.

Thank you, Dr. David and Dr. Brian ‚Äî you have both made a profound difference in our lives. Looking forward to seeing you again in three months, insha‚ÄôAllah.

With heartfelt appreciation,"

From the very start, the process has been structured and well-organized. Everything, from making appointments to registration, medication prescriptions, and treatment, is handled efficiently.

The orientation for newcomers is very helpful, and I appreciate the thoughtful details like offering home delivery for medication at no extra charge. NCCS also provides comprehensive cancer support services, including call and clinic support for managing side effects and mental health advice, which has been incredibly valuable throughout the treatment journey.

The nursing team here provides exceptional support that, in many instances, can be better than what one might experience with private specialists. Their dedication and professionalism truly stand out. Though not all hospitals are perfect, NCCS does their best in ensuring patients feel supported and cared for. They also encourage continuous improvement by asking for online feedback after every visit.

Even though mask requirements have been lifted, I still wear one to protect myself, especially when there's news about flu bugs. The accessibility of the center is also a plus‚Äîit's a short walk to the SGH cafeteria, which is handy when the caf√© on Level 2 is crowded or when I prefer other food options.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the oncologists, pharmacists, and nurses who have cared for me throughout this year. Your dedication and expertise make all the difference."

I came back to see her 2.5 years ago and have been regularly taking TCM meds, while undergoing monthly acupuncture treatment in the past few months. Acupuncture has been quite effective for me so far in relieving of my cramps and reducing blood clots, but I believe consistency is key to maintaining its effectiveness.

Am grateful most of all to have found an empathetic, personable, kind, caring, patient and helpful doctor who has always made me feel comfortable and at ease when sharing somewhat private details of my health issues, to best receive the most appropriate line of medical treatment. Dr Zhao is also professional and appears humble despite her seniority in the TCM field over years of experience. This makes me look forward to each consultation and treatment session with her, knowing I‚Äôm in good hands.üôÇü•∞üíØ

They are trying to sell old stock of bicycle. Tyres are so old it's spoilt within 1 month of use.
Customer service is the lowest in Singapore. Husband and wife want to fight when want to get the tyre fixed.
DO NOT buy from them anymore.
See tyre condition within 1 month. They are saying 1 month is already lasted too long.
Can't believe Singapore still have this type of customer service!!!

He dismissed it as minor, saying it would heal in a week. Thankfully, my parents didn‚Äôt feel right and took her to A&E. There, the hospital doctor said the wound was deep enough to see the bone, required an X-ray and five stitches, and even commented that the dressing used at the clinic is no longer recommended.

This clinic visit could have led to serious complications if we hadn‚Äôt sought a second opinion. Very poor judgment, no empathy, and unacceptable care."

Was a male doctor. I haven never encounter such a inpatient doctor and not experience at all. I was having a serious tonsillitis ( sore throat with white pus ) doc say is not serious at all . And give me eat 2 weeks of antibiotics.  Give me cought medicine whereby I don't have cough . Give me runny nose whereby I don't have runny nose . I ask him if nerofen can eat more than 600mg he ask me read the instructions myself . I think this doctor don't like paitent to ask many questions and I am having high fever every 4 hrs. So serious sickness but yet doctor still give me attitude reply. Very disappointing especially those young doctors ! Will never come back again !

I visited the clinic with my husband and we registered at 6.15 PM. The lady counter staff informed us that the doctor would start seeing patients at 6.30 PM. My husband was running a fever and feeling very unwell, so we politely asked if we could sit on the waiting chairs while waiting just 15 more minutes? However, the lady counter staff firmly replied, ""No.""
I was shocked by the lack of empathy and professionalism. Is this really how you treat patients who are clearly unwell and in need of care? It‚Äôs not just about policy,  its about basic humanity pls.

Moreover, the waiting time was excessively long. Even after the doctor started at 6.30 PM, we were still waiting as patient number 5 at 7.30 PM, while patient number 4 was still inside with the doctor.

I sincerely hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously and makes an effort to improve both the attitude of the front-desk staff and the efficiency of your services. Patients come to a clinic for help ‚Äî not to be treated coldly and made to wait in discomfort. There are already many negative reviews about this clinic, and I now understand why. I believe others had similar real experiences like ours. It‚Äôs not just people being harsh ‚Äî it‚Äôs because they were genuinely disappointed and upset."

The usual clinic is too packed and need advance booking. Decided to go forward with a faster alternative instead.

Doctor took a torchlight to look at my rashes and insist that he wanted me to take off my shorts (with undies on), calling in with a female assistant to look at my rash on my buttock area. Just FYI - I have rash all over my body. Including outer thighs, arms, elbows. Of all places he wants to see those that were inside clothing. Asked questions that seemed grey ‚Äúdo i always wear this type of undies‚Äù - could be checking if i am allergic to cloth material. Pulling my undies a little near to my middle to see rashes. And also pulling up my top a little to see my back if there were rashes before i could allow him to. Asked a few inappropriate questions. Without thinking much i answered all his questions.

Gist of the story: he diagnosed was that i am infested with mites/ lice called scabies. He prescribed a few low dosage itch pills to stop the itch. But was ineffective. Gave me a prescription to go to the local pharmacy to get a lotion for lice & mites treatment. To be applied from neck to the feet for 3 days.

Today: I visited my usual GP and she said it was just heat rash & eczema flaring up from the hot weather. If it was lice/ mites with that lotion it would‚Äôve already stopped itching and cleared up already. Spent a total of $57.35 + $15 for lotion. The medication was also deemed ineffective due to the low dosage. Not showing any effects of relieving itch too.

Doctor asked me twice about if i needed an Mc. I said no. He proceeded to ask me what do i work as (not needed to answer actually). Yes i do not need an MC but i need to cure my rashes and itch. It seemed like this clinic is just good at giving MC for people who tend to chao geng but not for serious health matters. If a much accurate diagnosis of my rash could be given i wouldn‚Äôt be going to another round to the doctor again.

Reached there at 8.30 am and when reached counter for registration, it was about 9 am. Quite a number of people q before me. I got no. 17.

The best part came. When reached 10 am, only reached no. 7. I was starved badly and I gave up my blood test. I went to ask for my medicine instead. Waiting until 10.15 am, my medicine still not prepared. Then I went for my breakfast because seriously cannot taban already. After I back from my breakfast around 10.30 am, the q no. was only 10. Then the doctor saw my request for medicine. She refused to give the medicine just like that and asked the nurse to take my blood pressure and until I met her in her room by cutting the q. After a short consultation, I left the clinic at 11.30 am and it has not reached no. 17.

Just think about I need to starve to do the blood test. If follow today's time, I need to wait until at least 12 pm. I will be starving for my breakfast and lunch and DO NOTHING but just wait there. I don't understand why took so long for a patient to do the blood test and how come the q no so slow. If understaff or lack of doctor, please out front to inform and don't let people like me starving for so long and waiting for so long.

Very disappointed today, despite I got the good consultation previously from the doctors. My time can't be wasted just like that."

When the carbonara was served, it was served with a thumb touching the gravy / sauce that was on the edge of plate but linked with rest of the food inside the plate.

I chose Rise & Grind Coffee Co. for a recent business lunch, drawn by its reputation as a comfortable cafe. The setting was certainly pleasant, offering a relaxed and suitable environment for a midday meeting.

For my meal, I ordered the Pork Chop with Black Pepper Sauce. I must commend the kitchen on the marinade, which was clearly well-executed and delivered good flavour. However, I found the pork chop itself to be overcooked, resulting in a texture that was a little too tough. The long black I had was decent, serving its purpose as a coffee but not particularly standing out in its flavour profile.

In terms of service, it was okay. I noticed that a few tables required prompting before the crew came over to clean them, which felt a bit less proactive than I would have liked. On a prior note, the booking experience was not as smooth as it could have been, with the payment gateway presenting a bit of a challenge.

While the food and service were acceptable, there are certainly areas for improvement. A more attentive approach to table maintenance and a smoother booking process would enhance the overall experience. The pork chop has great potential, and with a little more care in the cooking, it could be a truly excellent dish.

Overall, Rise & Grind Coffee Co. is a fine choice for a casual business lunch due to its atmosphere. However, I hope they can refine their operational processes and consistency in the kitchen to better match their comfortable setting."

The waffle is cheaper than traditional waffle costs $1.50 for 2 slices with a few choices of filling. We opt for the peanut butter filling and kaya filling but size is smaller. Their peanut butter is those lava and thick texture which I like. However I feel the waffle have no flavour on it own and nothing special. Also order their honey lemon $3 and decent ok only. There also a lot of old school fruit tart and cakes at a reasonable price as well as kaya toast with eggs and kopi to go with.

Their salmon pasta always sets me on fire ‚Äî it‚Äôs the main reason I keep coming back! The sauce is creamy, and the salmon is perfectly cooked.

Thankfully, I also ordered the truffle cheese fries ‚Äî not the best I‚Äôve had, but still very tasty, nicely seasoned, and had a good truffle aroma.

We didn‚Äôt manage to try the desserts because we were too full from the mains ‚Äî which shows the portion sizes are quite generous, and pricing feels reasonable.

Upon entering, none of the staff greeted me, which was a bit odd given it wasn‚Äôt busy. I decided to take a seat at the bar stools near the entrance and cashier. The staff looked occupied, so I didn‚Äôt mind the lack of attention at first.

About 5 minutes later, a staff member approached me and asked if I was waiting for a table. I explained that I was waiting for friends and thought I‚Äôd have a coffee in the meantime. She then asked if I had a reservation, which caught me off guard‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt aware one was needed. I replied honestly, saying I didn‚Äôt know. She then asked what time my friends would arrive, and when I said around 6:30‚Äì7:00pm, she told me there would be a crowd coming at 7pm.

At that point, I felt uncomfortable and slightly offended‚Äîwas I being indirectly told to leave? I reassured her that I just wanted to have my coffee and would leave before the crowd came. I ended up ordering my coffee and leaving shortly after.

While I understand if there were upcoming reservations, the way it was communicated made the experience feel unwelcoming. A bit more warmth and clarity would‚Äôve gone a long way.

Our family of 3 had the escargots, seafood stew and tenderloin steak.

The escargots were drenched in garlic butter and each bite was a burst of flavour. My 7 year old son who refused to eat escargots became a convert after trying them. The steak was done to medium rare perfection and we enjoyed every bit of it. The seafood stew was good too but we felt the ingredients could be a bit fresher. The steak was definitely my highlight of the night.

I wish they had draft beer instead of bottled beer, but overall we had a great family meal with nostalgic cosy vibes."

We have visited mariners‚Äô corner, located at sunset way.

We have ordered a salmon dish and a thermidor prawns with chicken chop set meal. The set meal also comes with a salad, soup of the day, tea/coffee and dessert.

1st look at the dishes, i must say i quite like the color. I have wasted no time digging in to the greens 1st. Not bad. Then i tried the mash potatoe, quite decent too. Put the prawns to the side, attacked the chicken chop. Wow i must say i am impressed by the chop. Nice and soft. Sauce is really good. Just take note not to wait too long to eat it. Because it taste nice when it‚Äôs warm, thereafter when it goes cold, it gets pretty tough.

Salmon is pretty tough to begin with. Personally i didn‚Äôt really liked it. Especially when the price is not cheap. Makes me rethink why did we order this dish. Maybe we should have ordered something else. I hope my honest feedback can make you decide which dish to order.

The prawns are not too bad. Not the best ever but decent.

Can go and try if you are near that area. Try the chicken chop üôÇ

Happened to be a busy day island-wide as most families are celebrating Mother's Day.

Offered seating alfresco (with shelter from sun/rain). Ox tail stew was nice without overpowering spices. The buttered vegetables a tad bland, may be to better complement the stew.

Topped up $5.80 to 1 order to complete the meal with garlic bread (2 slices), a soup, a salad, a cake for dessert and hot coffee/tea.

The salad was a little lacklustre, in part due to the unusual colour of the dressing. Opined that the ox tail stew as a meal is sufficient unless you are a big eater. Can forgo the soup ü§∑"

Very limited seats inside air-con area, so for big groups you are expected to sit outdoor, it is sheltered but not meant for bad weather. Do expect crowd during meal time though.

And now, some items require you to take a photo of the barcode to get an additional discount, You have to show it to the cashier, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE PAYING EXTRA.

My mum has forgotten about it sometimes because it requires 3 4 photo taking of the barcode. It‚Äôs ridiculous.

It shouldn't be the customer's job to take a photo of the barcode just to get a discount.
It‚Äôs an outrageously outdated method. Clearly shows the company is sleeping and being lazy.

During the digital migration, it was handled poorly, resulting in some loss of points. It appeared suddenly and there weren‚Äôt any plans to push out this migration progressively.

Out of nowhere. A manual membership card wasn‚Äôt accepted. You have to download their crappy app (that hang and couldn‚Äôt even load properly, doing it at the cashier will just hold up the queue).
You are serving the senior generation. You shouldn't expect the elderly to understand so quickly to migrate their membership digitally or take a photo of the barcode to get an additional discount.

Really poor quality of service and poor management to make customers' lives easier."

This clinic doesn‚Äôt offer subsidised vaccination pricing as per MOH subsidised rate guidelines despite booking via MOH site, so it‚Äôs definitely pricier than normal. Based on clinic‚Äôs explanation, only selected clinics may offer subsidised vaccination, and some may charge consultation fees. Maximum price for flu vaccine per MOH guidelines is $70 (based on clinic‚Äôs explanation) and that was what was charged & paid. Do check before heading over as we‚Äôve had to pay almost 2x the price compared to other clinic. Other clinic only charged my family member $38 btw.

MAJOR REGRET not checking.

Update after seeing Dr Tang‚Äôs reply:
We did show Green CHAS card to the staff, but was still told there‚Äôs no subsidy at all (only CHAS chronic card is entitled for discount) even though MOH and Vaccine.gov.sg states that with Green CHAS card will be $35. We also booked the flu vaccine appointment via MOH‚Äôs website click through, assuming it‚Äôll direct us to clinics under the same pricing scheme but had a rude shock when a nearby clinic from home charged my other family member $38.15 while this clinic charged us $70. Not sure where the discrepancies are or if this clinic just doesn‚Äôt offer subsidised rates per MOH‚Äôs guidelines. Still unsatisfied as we did not get any clear explanation as to why there are price differences. The staff only mentioned ‚Äúthis is our clinic pricing, only CHAS chronic is entitled to staff discount‚Äù."

We had lunch on a Friday. Absolutely loved the atmosphere. Simple and we got the seating inside, which has aircon, very comfortable.

Food was amazing!

My must try‚Äôs are:
1) Mala Soup (of course)
2) Beef Balls
3) Mushroom Soup
4) Premium Beef (I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called)

If you haven‚Äôt given HahaHotpot a try, you need to. It‚Äôs absolutely amazing!

Btw, they do deliveries too!

One bad experience is that the Miso soup cover has formed a kind of vacuum and it makes the lid  difficult to open. And when opened , the soup tend to spill / lid fly away. I recommend to change to an easier to open lid, because not only did I experience this opening lid challenge, my colleague also experience similar case. The crew quickly changed new green tea for me when I accidentally bumped and dropped the Drink. Kudos to the great quick Service.

Although server came back to inform the one I ordered was out of stock and they‚Äôd gladly refund the wrong bottle served to us but it‚Äôll be good if this was done upfront instead ie inform us the one we ordered was outta stock and check if we wish to order some others. The eventual bottle that was served to us didn‚Äôt even offer me any buzz even though it showed 14% alcohol on the back of the bottle. Not sure if it was kept too long cos there were definitely some yellow stuff floating on the surface when we poured the drink into a cup.

Not likely to come back."

- Spacious, well ventilated (high ceiling and giant fans), mid-sized hawker center.
- Has a small wet market section with about a dozen stalls.
- Run by the Kopitiam Group.
- Can pay using PayNow/PayLah! QR, cash (getting uncommon), CDC vouchers or the NTUC app. Best using the NTUC app as you get a 10% discount.
- Stalls are not as many as the larger hawker centers, but I think there is enough variety for everyone.
- The biggest plus point is it's clean. The cleaning staff work rather efficiently to clean the floors and the tables. The dirty plates are also moved to the closed washing bay quickly.
- As a result, rarely see birds or pigeons and the hawker center is not littered with bird droppings.
- Most people return their plates and trays, but as always there are some who do not do their part (including. dirty wash basins, and toilets)...
- Kudos to the cleaning crew!"

I think for other people who wants to eat croffle can try at the croffle shop instead.

Tried the croffle, but for 10 dollars it is overpriced for a small waffle and not filling. Coffeeshop waffle is bigger than this waffle. The waffle is just okay nothing speical. The ice cream mars chocolate is quite okay though, got chocolate bits.  I think chocolate gelato cup is better worth for half the price instead of adding on waffle, but as other commentors said, the portion size very small.

Price 0/5
Portion size 1/5
Food (ice cream only) 4/5 not bad."

If you wanna sweat it out and need motivation to do so. This BFT, especially Pioneer branch is the place to go.

Will be back soon!"

Owners are incredibly friendly. Coaches are professional and will push you along during the session. Just completed my 2 weeks trial and am looking forward to future sessions. If you want to trial BFT, please consider this outlet as they provide Heart Rate Monitor as well, which allows you to follow their system closely. This is the first outlet which I know that actually provides the HRM during trial period. COME DOWN AND TRY NOW."

While my fav is the Korean kimchi ramen w pork. Nice tasty kimchi couple w d tasty soup and noodle. 1 of the best that I have ever eaten.

That's the summary of it.

Plenty of parking at B1.
Food wise, it also seems to be the franchise or branches of other famous stalls in Sg.
But sadly they only remember to bring the name but not the recipe n taste.
We felt the taste wise of some food we tried was way off and not nice at all.

Guess maybe only 3-4 nice stalls here at max.
Hearsay there's been quite a number of changes in stalls. It's. Great place for the residents here for sure. Saw a few blks which are just next to this, lucky fellows."
