Anytime Fitness,"Management in this region is not the best! Note that regardless of your circumstances, they will give the excuse that “their policy is consistent across all clubs” and charge you extra when pausing membership. Which is not true, if your AF is under the northeast side, the management is more lenient and understanding of your circumstances. Just a PSA to not use the gym in this region so often to the point ur membership is converted here! Stick to other AF in the other region :-)",https://www.anytimefitness.sg/gyms/sg-0095/pioneer-mall-south-west/,"638 Jurong West Street 61, #03-01 Pioneer Mall",Gym,0,0,0.0,0.017241379310344827,3,Irrelevant

Rather than getting help on it, all i got was that I have to make payment by QR code online before 1st January or i will have the late fees incurred if I don't. I even replied confirming the fact, and yet, was sent the same exact email about payment must be made before 1st January. On top of that, next year onwards, there would be an increment of $10 but there was no prompt of it at all and it is $10 more per what i signed a year ago.

He was telling me about the evolt machine and benefits and kept being pushy. He kept asking me about my schedule and when I would come to the gym. He also assumed “you come when you feel like it?” before I could tell him when I would usually come to the gym. After a while, I was clearly not interested and told him that I’ll try it out the following week. I also said I’m busy most days and I was trying to finish my workout quickly at the time but he kept asking me the specific days and timings I would show up to the gym. Throughout the conversation, he was being pushy, somewhat intimidating and very pressuring. It isn’t easy to workout alone as a woman and this interaction left a bad taste.

So I chose a pant, spent time in the fitting room and queuing too, only for them to tell me that there was no discount. I had to go back to the place as I thought I had read wrongly but I realised that I would not be the only one who would be confused, as their placement of pants and that Limited Offer sign can cause confusion. After our feedback to the various staffs,  they tried to reach out to the manager who in the end, did not bother coming out and attending to us which I found irresponsible.

I asked Charles for his recommendations based on what I would use the PC for, and he was very friendly and knowledgeable. He did not try to upsell me any components and even told me 4070TS is too much for my use case lol! He also answered my other questions patiently. Even though I texted him late at night, his replies were quick.

I paid a deposit a few hours later on Sunday morning (6 AM) and the PC was delivered the very next day on Monday. He gave me timely updates on the assembly, testing and delivery. He also helped to hook up the PC to my monitors and accessories to check if everything was good and if I had any questions.

I previously got a PC from the famous “A” brand and I must say the service is day and night. On top of that, the price given by Charles is very competitive (actually, it is even more affordable than the other few merchants I asked).

I have some background knowledge having built my own pc before but due to time constraints and life, decided to seek services to assemble all. So I was looking into the parts that boss recommended and I could see that he knows his stuff well. The guy was patient and quick in his response to answer my queries.

Finally, the time from confirming build to assembly to delivery was really fast, am grateful for delivering all the boxes as well promptly.

Since I'm already quite familiar with what needs to be done, Charles was very patient with my questions and demands, in upgrading my PC to exactly what I wanted. And this includes cloning my OS onto the new system (which is famously troublesome thanks to a certain OS software). He also offered good suggestions against my initial requirements which I verified and accepted.
Specific parts were obtained for my upgrade and to top it off, he fixed up my PC by the next day! My PC is rocking well in exactly the way I want it and I earnestly recommend their services to anyone who needs help with their PCs.",http://www.goshiningpc.com/,"21 Woodlands Cl, #08-05 Primz Bizhub",Computer store,0,1,0.0,0.0,4,Advertisement

He ran through couple of stress test and determined the problem is not my PC but probably one of my peripherals that is causing the issue. True enough. By process of elimination the problem was really my power strip which Charles did suggested for me to check.

And for all the trouble, he did not charge me any fee even when I insist on paying for his time.

Highly recommended for his expertise and honesty if anyone has hardware issues or need a new built for gaming or workstation.",http://www.goshiningpc.com/,"21 Woodlands Cl, #08-05 Primz Bizhub",Computer store,0,0,0.0,0.0,3,Irrelevant

Finally after many messages on carousell and whatsapp i settled for this beautiful beast.

What I really like from Charles is that he is honest and transparent about what parts is necessary for the purpose of the PC and will not over offer things that you do not need, he is also patient and provides quick and easy to understand answers to all your questions. He also tailors to your needs for example, I was not very into the March Promo case that was used as default so he offered me many more options for my budget, these little steps shows how professional and niche he at his job.

313@somerset,"Had lunch at Food Republic in 313 Mall. Saw a new stall “Yuen Kee Dumplings” so we decided to give it a try.

There was a queue of 7 waiting to place their orders, while another maybe 5 other patrons waiting at the side for their meals to be prepared.

Got to place our orders after about 10 minutes, thereafter waited another 10 minutes for our orders to be ready.

We ordered their “popular” Shrimp & Crab Roe Wanton in Cantonese Style Soup. We were allowed to choose the type of soup or finishes (spicy, garlic, etc). $10.80.

Also the Chives & Pork Dumplings (like gyoza). For this we chose Viral Mixed Sauce with Chilli. $7.80.

The 10 Wantons were pretty big, wrapped with lots of shrimps and some crab roe, however I tasted like Ikura. The soup was clear and tasty. Overall quite good.

There were 9 pieces of Chives & Pork Dumplings in the other order. The sauce was something like chilli garlic sauce but not so heavy. They were sprinkled with peanut sauces. We found the flour wraps a little “rough”; but tasted nice overall.

Prices were reasonable.

We finished our meal with our favorite Yuan Yang from the Toast Box Stall, next door.",http://www.313somerset.com.sg/,313 Orchard Rd,Shopping mall,0,0,0.0,0.0070921985815602835,3,Irrelevant

Paragon Shopping Centre,"Was at Paragon yesterday evening between 6.30-7.30. Visited a Club 21 pop up sale store on level 2. The experience there with the so call salesperson wasn’t good. The store was selling most brands from Club 21 were slashing prices up to 70- 80 percent discount. I asked to reserved a pair of shoes in the afternoon and put at the counter as I need to rush off to meet clients. As a salesperson myself, this service given to me was below standard. Club 21 is a respectable company in Singapore having this young managers with no respect to customer is very bad. When I went back to buy the shoes, I couldn’t find it, so one lady brought out the shoes and told me it’s sales item, you asked my part time to keep for you she don’t know anything , if we sold the shoes away there is nothing we can do! This sentence , sounds rude to me. She looked down on customers that are buying sales item, if she can’t respect customers that are buying sales item, DON’T GIVE DISCOUNT period.",https://www.paragon.com.sg/,290 Orchard Rd,Shopping mall,0,1,0.0,0.008130081300813009,4,Advertisement

First time, we had complained about a large dog being too close to the children playing there. When we called them, they didn't come out to speak to the owner about leashing their dog closer to them. Second time, we complained about playground maintenance cleaning the place with high pressure water jets who went about cleaning without informing us that they would be switching off the equipment nor did they take any precaution from ensuring the children were safe, away from the high pressure water jets. Again, the CC staff did nothing. They didn't come out to talk to the maintenance team, nor did they check in on us or the children. Horrible experience.

Paragon Shopping Centre,"I'm usually quite hesitant to leave negative reviews but I hope this won't be the experience of others in the future. I was at Paragon today and really needed to charge my phone and when I walked past the concierge I noticed that they had a sign stating that they offer portable chargers. When I went up to ask if I could borrow or rent one, the lady at the concierge didn't even look at me until i paused to wait for her to look up and assumed she was busy even though she already said ""hi"" while looking down. She then told me I had to pay a $50 deposit to borrow the portable charger, which I am completely fine with and understand the need for. She appeared shocked when I said I was fine with the $50 deposit so I just said it again that I was completely fine with it. She continued staring at me and just said ""$50 deposit"" which honestly confused me because she didn't ask me how I wanted to pay and didn't tell me only cash was accepted and repeated it until I asked her if only cash payment was available. I then told her that i didn't have cash and asked if card payment was available to which she replied ""there's an ATM""... I don't carry cash around and that's not her fault but I really think that for a mall like  paragon that the staff, especially at the concierge to have some sort of customer service training. I also think it would be a good idea to allow for card payment for the $50 deposit as many don't carry cash anymore especially if it is advertised at the concierge.",https://www.paragon.com.sg/,290 Orchard Rd,Shopping mall,0,1,0.0,0.013793103448275862,4,Advertisement

So I just went there but that huge lady with short hair refused me to see doc saying that their slots are all taken.

I even requested and do not mind to take the very last slot but still that nurse refused me and ask me to find other clinics which I was not able to find as they were all closed.

However, there is huge room for improvement at the counter. We were on time for appointment,  waited 10 minutes and was attended to Dr Adrian promptly. Next, was a 20-minute wait for medicine and the clinic was empty. I am an advocate of respect towards service staff and I believe this should be mutual when handling patients. We checked in every 10-minute intervals because my elderly mother is feeling unwell. For the first check, Nurse Stella who was busy, told me to take a seat and that her colleagues would attend to me when it is ready. We didn’t hear anything after 10 minutes. Before we knew it, there was a patient who walked in to purchase medicine off the shelf and he was attended to promptly by another nurse. After he collected his medicine and made his payment, we were still waiting to be called. When we checked on status again, nurse Stella got visibly irritated, spoke louder and told us that the medicine had to be reviewed by the doctor. Then, she nudged her colleague to speed up and commented loudly “faster, patient asked and asked”. It was as if it was deliberate. When her colleague finally ended the call, I realised the main holdup was because the name labels had yet to be pasted on the prescribed medicine. It reflects absolute inefficiency and also disrespect for patients’ time. I would have understood if they were busy and explained why they needed more time.

Went into the clinic at around 8pm feeling really sick and was told that they are fully booked, and I would need to book an appointment to see the doctor and I do understand that they might be short staffed. My vision was getting really blurry due to high fever from covid so I asked questions like whether they could recommend me a nearby clinic where I can get myself checked and some medicine as well.

However, instead of speaking nicely, one of the clinic assistants (short haired chinese lady) ""chased me"" out of the clinic and kept cutting me short. Told me that I should go and google it myself and pointed to the door while telling me to leave the clinic. Terrible service staff. Do not recommend. Don't bother performing your job if you're just going to be super rude towards patients who really needed some assistance.

Greenhouse Bistro,"This is probably one of the most westerly restaurants (the other being the one at Raffles Marina near the second link) in Singapore. Located in Tuas West, this restaurant is located in a 'ulu' industrial flat, amongst factories and industrial buildings.
The Place:
The hugh dining hall was decorated with many posters of food and LED wordings on the walls, which, together with the plastic plants, seem somewhat crowded and tacky. The bar counter was too crowded with equipments and utensils, and was overshadowed by the large posters hanging over it. The decor could improve with a better interior designer.
The Food
I had the truffles olio aglio pasta with New Zealand ribeye. The pasta was perfectly cooked, with a nice degree of al-dente. The truffles oil add a hint of umami to the olive oil-based sauce, without overpowering it. The ribeye was a bit tough, probably due to the lack of marbling of the New Zealand steak, but was well cooked and not dry, attesting to the skill and care of the chef. The addition of black cavier on the steak, although did not add to the flavour, however did enhance the presentation of the dish. The restaurant was having a promotion of Japanese oysters - $1 for each raw oyster. The plump oyster tasted full of briny freshness, and was creamy in textual.
Conclusion
It is worth a visit if you are around the area.",,"30 Tuas Bay Dr, #01-00",Restaurant,0,1,0.0,0.013513513513513514,4,Advertisement

Decathlon - Joo Koon,"Dear Decathlon Team,

I would like to share my recent experience at your Joon Koon outlet. The service at the workshop was very slow, with only one staff member attending to many customers. This led to long queues and a lot of waiting time.

It seems that the store is understaffed, especially during weekends when there are many customers with issues such as bike or badminton racket servicing. The slow service caused quite a frustrating experience for me, and I believe for other customers as well.

I hope Decathlon can improve the staffing and service speed at the Joon Koon workshop to provide a smoother experience for customers.",https://www.decathlon.sg/s/sports-stores/joo-koon?utm_source=google-my-business&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb,"1 Joo Koon Cir, #02-21 Fair Price Hub",Sporting goods store,0,0,0.0,0.03896103896103896,3,Irrelevant

UNIQLO,"I purchased during the SG60 promotion, so I spent $60 thinking I would receive a $6 voucher. However, I ended up getting nothing, as you mentioned my item was a pre-order item. In order to qualify for the $6 voucher, I had to choose the ""Click and Collect"" option at the Lot 1 Uniqlo outlet.

When I later received your email stating that the item could not be collected during the promotion period, I decided to change the Click and Collect option to home delivery instead. However, the Uniqlo staff did not allow this change. This kind of inflexibility made me very frustrated, and in the end, I received nothing from this promotion.

If I had known it would be like this, I would not have joined this Uniqlo promotion at all. I am extremely disappointed.",https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/,"63 Jurong West Central 3, #03-17 JP2",Clothing store,0,1,0.0,0.0,4,Advertisement

UNIQLO,"I ordered a pair of jeans and a shirt online for a company dinner and the app suggested size 40 for the jeans. Unfortunately, that size was too big and I went down to Jurong Point store to make an exchange the following day.

Truthfully, I was dissatisfied with the way the Supervisor there handled this issue.  He did not seem keen to provide the necessary assistance.

He checked for a while but informed me that the system wasn't updated and that there wasn't much he could do. Is it my problem that the system was not updated?

I do realize that he could have approached or made a call to other management for assistance but he failed. I asked if there was any other way for me to make an exchange and he informed me he could help to check with the other stores except that I have to travel to that particular store for the exchange but he didn't make the call. I could not believe it as I knew that some outlets would provide inter-store transfers upon request.

He also suggested exchanging for other items which I was not keen on.

Since he could not provide a further solution to this issue, I left the store but returned to him shortly as I wasn't satisfied with his “don't care” attitude. I showed him that the online has available pieces but he kept telling me his system was not updated.

Eventually, to avoid further dissatisfaction, I left the store feeling annoyed and furious. I know he could do something but he chose not to.

Finally, I managed to obtain the exchange from other outlets. A bad experience from this outlet.

Put in 2 stars because one of the staff at the cashier rendered his assistance before calling the supervisor to step in.",https://www.uniqlo.com/sg/en/,"63 Jurong West Central 3, #03-17 JP2",Clothing store,0,0,0.0,0.01282051282051282,3,Irrelevant

Anytime Fitness,"Checked out Boon Lay Anytime Fitness for the first time and I’ve got to say — I’m really impressed! The gym has pretty much everything you need. Loads of machines, a wide range of equipment, and the free weights go all the way up to 50kg. The best part? They actually have two pairs of each dumbbell, so no need to fight over weights with anyone. Plenty of benches too, so you’re not stuck waiting around.

Big shoutout to Wandi at the front desk — super friendly and helpful! He made me feel really welcome on my first visit. Give that guy a pay raise!

The gym is clean and well-maintained, with four toilets/showers so it’s easy to freshen up after your workout. There’s even a vending machine with protein shakes, which is a lifesaver if you forget to bring yours.

All in all, awesome vibe, solid equipment, and great service. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in the Boon Lay area!",https://www.anytimefitness.sg/gyms/SG-0063/boon-lay-south-west/,"221 Boon Lay Pl, #03-106",Gym,0,0,0.1,0.03333333333333333,3,Irrelevant

Additionally, the management needs to focus on enforcing gym rules consistently to ensure fairness among all users. For instance, despite the gym’s policy requiring proper attire, I’ve noticed several instances where members were either barefoot or wearing slippers, which raises safety concerns.

To add to that, just yesterday, I saw someone using the treadmill shirtless. This not only poses a hygiene issue—with sweat potentially spreading onto the equipment—but also creates an uncomfortable environment. What’s more concerning is that this happened while a staff member was present, yet no action was taken.

Fullerton Dental,"Dr. Mok who works every Wednesday is really irresponsible.

40 days ago I paid a very high price to have a tooth fixed. After about 40 days, the filling developed a problem and it hurt when I drank cold water. So, I suspect that the material has fallen out, but of course, it could be something else, so I want to go for a review. Dr. Mok said she would remove the previous material and replace it with one that was temporary and did not guarantee results. I expressed my concern because once the medication failed, my teeth would be exposed and more damage would be done. Then,  after I refused to use this material, I asked if I could use the original material and Dr. Mok refused. So I decided not to change because, after all, no one wants to revert to a temporary, less good-looking material without taking that much risk. Dr. Mok went on to say that if I were to leave, she would have to take a photograph of my teeth to prove that there was nothing wrong with her fillings. I thought this was utterly ridiculous. If she was so adamant that there was no problem, why did she change me to a bad material in the first place? If I don't change the material, do I have to prove that her padding is fine? I felt that she was simply shirking her responsibility. She would not allow me to leave if I refused to have my photo taken because the case had to be documented.

Most important, I was only charged 150 dollars for the treatment! So if you must go to the campus clinic, avoid Dr Mok (she is on duty on Wednesdays). I hope she is the only one like this in the clinic. Otherwise, shame on the clinic!

A follow-up: So I gave them the benefit of doubt after they told me that they saw my review and listened to the doctor's explanations, albeit belated, for the fees and her rationale for the arrangement of the treatment. She claims that she did not my email that I sent her earlier enquiring why so many sessions were needed. Although it seems really odd that the email (which I sent through my NTU work email address) did not go to her gmail, let's just believe it is a technical problem. She also explains to me why she did not refer me to a specialist during the first visit because she thought she could handle it. All in all, she tried to explain everything to me, and yet I am not quite fully convinced to be honest. I just wish that the communication could have been done earlier and more effectively. I also hope that doctors could be more cautious and thoughtful when providing their medical advice in the future. And I encourage those who are going to seek dental service to speak for their needs and communicate immediately whenever you have doubts.
On another note, I appreciate their good attitude and desire to communicate with me.",,"36 Nanyang Ave, #01-01/02",Dental clinic,0,0,0.0,0.010050251256281407,3,Irrelevant

However, on our second and third visits, the quality noticeably declined. We ordered similar items each time: the spicy lemongrass lime fish, tofu with spinach, and Tom Yum (chicken or seafood). Unfortunately, after both recent visits, all of us developed severe sore throats, which may suggest a heavy use of MSG.

Beyond that, the flavors didn’t feel as authentic as we had hoped. The balance of spices and ingredients seemed off, and the overall experience left us disappointed.

Anytime Fitness,"Extremely Disappointed with the Staff and Management at Anytime Fitness Tampines Mart

I’ve never experienced such poor customer service at a gym until I signed up here. From the very beginning, the Malay male staff who handled my registration was rude, dismissive, and seemed completely uninterested in assisting. It already felt like I was being judged just for being there.

When I tried to request a respectful termination of my membership, I was met with even worse treatment over the phone. Rara, another Malay staff member, was condescending, disrespectful, and completely lacking in basic courtesy. The way she spoke was offensive, and the attitude she displayed made it very clear that the gym has zero regard for customer service—especially if you’re not who they want to treat well.

What’s even more disappointing is how obvious it is that this gym treats people based on how they look. If you’re conventionally attractive, you’re treated with smiles and attention. If not, you’re talked down to like you don’t matter.

Even Virgin Active, a far more premium gym, didn’t treat me like this when I chose not to renew my membership. They handled it with professionalism, respect, and class—something this outlet clearly lacks.

Avoid this place. The management needs serious retraining, and the staff culture—especially those mentioned—needs to be re-evaluated.

Tongue Tip Lanzhou Beef Noodle 舌尖尖 (Downtown East),"This is definitely a must try noodle shop. There are 8 type of noodle cut to choose from, ranging from very thin to fat and broad.

Whats even better, you can refill your noodles unlimitedly if your order a large portion. The refilled noodles can be of any noodle cut. If you are a big eater, you definitely have the chance to try all 8 of them.

If both of you are small eaters and decided to share a big bowl, you can also refill but refill one time only.

I personally like the dry version and the chilli taste great. While the noodle came with soup, you may also separate the noodle from the soup with another bowl and season the sauce yourself using their given chilli and vinegar. Try until you got your perfect proportion.

Definitely will be back. And try their plum juice again.",https://www.facebook.com/Tonguetipbeefnoodles/,1 Pasir Ris Close E!Avenue@Downtown East #02-322,Halal restaurant,0,0,0.0,0.010869565217391304,3,Irrelevant

What stood out most was her sincerity, she took the time to recommend dishes, advised us not to over-order since we only had four people, and made sure we felt comfortable. Despite having to walk extra rounds for customers, she never once showed frustration or a grumpy face.

Her warmth and attentiveness made the dining experience feel homely, and her constant smile really brightened up our day.

Punggol Oasis's outlet is conveniently located just beside Oasis Punggol LRT stn (East Bound, 2 stops from Punggol Central). On the first storey.

I felt the consistency of the food across Tampines 1, Bugis & Punggol Oasis is pretty much the same (which is good).

However, the service here was just.. fine. It wasn't really peak dining hours. But initially I was waiting to be served a table. So I was in the queue. But wasn't attended to. So I had to walk in & get myself a table as the customer infront was just in the way.

I also find the luo han guo beverage at this outlet a little sweeter. As compared to Bugis+ 's.

Whisk & Paddle,"I’ve visited Whisk & Paddle a few times and every dish I’ve tried has been consistently great! The mac and cheese is a must-try — rich, creamy, and surprisingly good. I also recently tried their cream cheese garlic bread, and I’ll definitely be coming back just for that.

What I love most is the location — it’s right next to the park connector, so it’s the perfect spot to chill and have brunch after a morning run.

The only small downside is the indoor temperature. The staff mentioned they leave the glass door open because of people coming in and out, but I couldn’t quite understand the purpose of having a glass door then — isn’t it meant to help keep the cool air inside? It did make the indoor area feel a little warm during my visit.

Still, it’s one of my favourite brunch spots, and I highly recommend it!",http://www.whiskandpaddle.com.sg/,10 Tebing Ln,Cafe,0,0,0.0,0.018518518518518517,3,Irrelevant

The sauce is alittle too thick and creamy especially when I was still waiting for my friend food to arrived. And it is little more salty. If it gets cold the saltiness is more obvious. Not sure it my problem, but I cannot feel it is laksa enough, something missing.

Whisk & Paddle,"The oysters were not cold although the shells and plate were full of ice. We assume it would taste fresher and slightly tastier if it is so. The tacos were stuck together with the beef, cheese and some salsa. It was a mess and very hard to consume while we had to seperate each bite with so much difficulty and trouble. It would be better if the beef, cheese and salsa were given individually with the same generous portions. The tacos were so crispy but the combination made it hard to eat and made the tacos soggy. The soup was full of seafood umami and the beef was the highlight of the day. Perfectly medium rare and the meat melted in your mouth.

Atmosphere was great. It wasn't crowded at that hour, and we got to sit outside where it was calm and relaxing. There was even a live band opposite singing Mandarin songs, which added a nice touch to the evening.

Pet-friendly too. Saw a few people dining outdoors with their dogs, which was nice to see.

Pioneer Medical Centre,"I would like to raise a concern regarding my helper’s experience at your clinic this morning, 27 June 2025.

My helper arrived at the clinic at 7:40 AM, ahead of your opening time at 8:30 AM, in preparation for her scheduled medical checkup. However, once the clinic opened, she was rejected for the checkup and was told she would need to return on Sunday instead.

When my helper called to inform me, she was told the reason for the rejection was that the male doctor on duty could not perform a blood draw for her, and that a female doctor would only be available on Sunday. I found this explanation puzzling, so I called the clinic myself for clarification.

Despite my attempts to understand the situation, I was only told again that the male doctor cannot take her blood, with no valid explanation provided. I even asked whether the doctor was a trainee (which could explain certain limitations), but was told he was not. I also asked whether a nurse could perform the blood draw, and was informed that the clinic does not have a nurse.

I find this situation extremely frustrating. My helper waited nearly an hour outside the clinic, only to be turned away and asked to return two days later. This feels both inefficient and inconsiderate, especially since no prior notice was given about the limitations of your staff or service.

I would appreciate it if someone could explain why this happened, and more importantly, advise where I can escalate this feedback so that other patients do not face similar experiences in the future.

Thank you for your attention, and I hope to receive a proper explanation soon.",,"651 Jurong West Street 61, #01-06",Medical clinic,0,0,0.0,0.012269938650306749,3,Irrelevant

There was no notice or information posted outside to inform patients about this, which could have easily prevented all this unnecessary waiting and stress, especially for a parent with a sick child.

Pioneer Medical Centre,"My family and I have been visiting this clinic for years. We understand that the waiting time is long but we were ok with it, as long as we are able to get treated. The doctors are generally nice, patient and thorough when we consult them. The counter staff were ok in general. However, my recent experience in this clinic was disappointing. The counter staff was extremely rude and impatience. I politely asked a question about collection of medication (we waited for at least 20-30 mins already but still not called upon to collect) but received the following unpleasant responses:
- Wait... Can you wait? Wait for few minutes... Just wait...
- I am very busy. You just have to wait... Doctor still need to XXX
- Doctor, can you XXX, the patients are complaining already
We understand that the counter staff may be busy (by the way there are 2 counter staff). As patients/family members, we do not want to make things difficult for the staff. What we wanted from the counter staff was that our responses to be answered politely, and be respected. I sat inside the clinic and observed that this counter lady, for every question that patients asked, her responses would be very hostile and rude, and unpleasant. One patient claimed that he was asked to come down to the clinic at 10.30am, but this counter rudely responded ""No, I did not said that (x2)"". The patient left the clinic, probably feeling why he was treated that unpleasant way when he was already sick.

All in all, doctors are good, but the system in terms of registration and medication collection needs to be improved. What is more important is, the counter staff (working on 26 Dec morning), needs to work the way she responds to patients. If every patients that asked you a question and you need to be so reactive, defensive, hostile and rude, then the problem lies with herself. She is busy, the clinic is busy, but so are we.

This is my third time visiting this clinic. This is close to my home, so I come back here. Except for the doctor's diagnosis, everything else is very bad. The last two times I came, many people had to wait at least 2-3 hours to register. Even after seeing the doctor and waiting to get medicine, they had to wait at least 20-30 minutes. Alas, if you need to wait for a long time, you can inform the patient in advance. Today I came to see a doctor. There were only three people waiting, but I still waited for more than an hour before it was my turn to see a doctor. It's really ridiculously slow and a waste of time. Inefficient.

They have free face painting for kids too for a few hrs during the morning. And free sunglasses for kids when they order a kids meal. However there is no lake or water view it’s all blocked by vegetation. So if you’re going for the view there is none. But still  nice place.

Whisk & Paddle,"While the service during our visit was fine, I unfortunately experienced severe gastroenteritis shortly after the meal. I strongly suspect the issue originated from the mushroom bruschetta, which appeared off in taste and texture. Out of the four pieces served, I consumed three, as my family did not enjoy them, and I felt compelled to finish the plate.

By the following Monday, I had no appetite, suffered diarrhea over 20 times throughout the day, and experienced severe vomiting (7 times). I even fainted twice due to dehydration and weakness. The vomit clearly contained undigested pieces of the mushroom bruschetta. In addition, the pizza we ordered was undercooked in the center, which further raises concerns about kitchen safety standards that evening.

I am not attaching photos or medical documents to this message, but I will gladly provide all necessary evidence and medical reports if needed for further investigation.

Please take this seriously and look into what may have gone wrong with the food preparation that evening. Food safety should always be a top priority, and I hope appropriate actions will be taken to prevent this from happening to others.

Looking forward to your response.

One of the available tables had finished meals with personal belongings left behind, but the family was nowhere in sight — they were clearly done eating and had gone to queue for a face painting event organised by the restaurant. We asked the manager if we could be seated there or if he could help move the unattended items so we could sit down.

He refused, saying there’s no time limit for diners and nothing could be done. Instead, he just told us to keep waiting, without giving any idea of when the family would return. Meanwhile, he stood from a distance, watching us and appearing smug and indifferent, offering no further help.

The lack of professionalism, flexibility, and basic courtesy was really disappointing — especially since this place used to be much better. Sadly, it’s not somewhere I’d return to or recommend after this experience.",http://www.whiskandpaddle.com.sg/,10 Tebing Ln,Cafe,0,1,0.0,0.0,4,Advertisement

Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,"I was told by one of the clinic assistant at 615pm that the doctor would be available at 7pm, with my turn likely around 8-830pm. This is frustrating, as if the clinic had answered my call earlier and issued a queue number, I could have gone home to have dinner, shower, and return on time. Instead, I had no choice but to wait at the clinic, as going home would have been too rushed and risked missing my turn.

I attempted to purchase medication but was met with unhelpful and poorly trained auntie staff who was unable to advise me on suitable options based on my prescription history. The lack of professionalism and competence from the clinic assistants is deeply disappointing.

I have decided not to return to this clinic and will lodge a formal complaint with the MOH and inform the area MP. Patients deserve better service and proper training for clinic staff to avoid such inconveniences.",,"960 Jurong West Street 92, #01-172",Medical Center,0,0,0.0,0.0,3,Irrelevant

Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,"If you’re looking for poor diagnosis, wasted time, and rude customer service, this clinic is the place to go.

I had the unfortunate experience of visiting this clinic twice in 2024, both times being consulted by Dr. Goh.

1.	August 2024 – I sprained my thumb, and the pain extended to my wrist. I explained that I couldn’t move my thumb, and my wrist was in significant pain. Dr. Goh briefly examined my wrist and simply stated that it was sprained. He prescribed ointment, but the pain worsened over the next week. I later visited a polyclinic where the doctor provided a more thorough assessment, diagnosing a nerve injury in my wrist that required a steroid injection. After being referred to a hospital and receiving the injection, I recovered fully within three days.

2.	September 2024 – I experienced heavy menstrual bleeding for two weeks. Dr. Goh advised me to take Norethisterone for 20 days to stop the flow. When I asked if it was necessary to take it for so many days, he insisted it was. He also added that I should take high blood pressure pills, despite me telling him I don’t have high blood pressure. He tested my blood pressure three times and insisted it was abnormal. I explained that I’ve had low blood pressure most of my life and that the elevated reading might be due to panic after bleeding excessively. He refused to reconsider, claiming that high blood pressure pills would reduce the bleeding. When I tested my blood pressure at home, it was normal.

3.	Patient Privacy Concerns – There’s absolutely no regard for patient privacy in this clinic. Two of the counter staff (packing medication and collecting payments) are respectful, speaking softly when dealing with patients’ personal information. However, the two seated behind the counter never get up and instead shout out patients’ full names, NRIC numbers, house addresses, and phone numbers for everyone to hear. During both of my visits, I witnessed them shouting at elderly patients. On one occasion, an elderly man mentioned it was his first time at the clinic, and the staff loudly responded, “Why must you come here?” I also saw a middle-aged woman buying medication without her physical NRIC. Instead of proper verification, the seated staff simply asked her to recite her NRIC number and proceeded to sell the medication. Isn’t this dangerous? Why isn’t there a proper process in place? People come to the clinic unwell – the least they deserve is respectful treatment.",,"960 Jurong West Street 92, #01-172",Medical Center,0,1,0.0,0.0,4,Advertisement

Apex Medical Centre Pte Ltd,"I dare say this clinic's handling covid the best out of the 4 clinics in the area.

They actually had signs out to tell patients when the queue is full (I highly recommend putting Chinese / Malay / Tamil signs too, at the side of the counter facing out to the door. Might help elderly patients and foreign workers who do not know English). This is already a world of difference from another clinic I shall not name, which I waited at for 30 mins yesterday only to be told to head over to the next door clinic and wait for 2.5H, because I'm not company sponsored. (They didn't even put a sign, srsly. Half the queue were not company sponsored.)

They also had special signs for people who self-tested ART positive too. Unlike yet another clinic in the area I shall not name, which claimed to do Swab tests online but turned me away in person saying 'no swab test here', APEX is legit. They understood the need when I told them I'm ART positive. They accommodated me when I asked if I could be given a queue no. for couple of hours later, despite the queue being full. Sure their phone line may be down, but their in-person service definitely benefits from that.

Service-wise, the staff were most efficient and polite, and I'm really thankful to Dr Tay, who cracked a joke when she saw how sombre I was about getting covid. The brave lady did not even bulk when I pulled down my mask, despite my fear of transmitting Covid to her. Kudos to her!

If there is one complain I do have, it would be the signage out at the front. It's good that APEX gets along so well with the Universal Dental Group that they even share similar letter fonts, but at first, I didn't dare go in thinking I might end up strapping myself in for a teeth drilling session. Now's not the time for sure, but in the future, when Covid does lighten up, hopefully the clinic will consider rebranding with different letter fonts, if not add an Upstairs and Downstairs Arrow logo alongside the different establishments.",,"960 Jurong West Street 92, #01-172",Medical Center,0,1,0.0,0.0044444444444444444,4,Advertisement

Message from NIE said that the complusory health screening is free. However, before any screening is done, I was asked to pay $55. The staff said that they had informed NIE about the miscommunication. Payment cannot be made by VISA as their machine is down.

Procedure:
Before the health screening, we had to print out a form to fill in physically. It's quite long, detailing not just our personal medical details but also our family's medical history. During the screening, the nurse fill in another form with the test results. After that, we were ushered to a tablet station to key in everything again digitally, rendering all the hard copies redundant. The digital form is 15 pages long, and the touchscreen is not sensitive, so it took a very long time to key in those information that took a very long time to complete on hardcopy in the first place.

Privacy:
The waiting room for X-ray consists of 2 rows of chairs placed facing each other and in uncomfortably close distance. (Note that females are required to remove their bras and wear only plain T-shirts.) There's a curtain to separate the waiting room from the rest of the clinic, but once we're called for the X-ray, we'll have to go out. (Ladies, you might want to go with a jacket to cover yourself.)

The gym here is amazing. Great use of space. A lot of machines. Not to mention there’s separate toilets for males and females (this is really awesome for a hijabi like me!) Staff are friendly and consistent. I’m not familiar with their names but I can recognise their faces

God knows how long I will have to wait AGAIN just to get my report endorsed! And they insist that I will need to pay $5 for endorsement! Seems like you cannot avoid paying to UHS by any means!

One Medical Clinic,"I came to One Medical Clinic after seeing 2 other GPs for my condition.

I found Dr Loke to be the most patient, caring, and skillful GP out of the 3. He really spends time to understand each condition, patients' concerns, and to share his knowledge and advice on health matters. He was also the only doctor whom I felt comfortable having my blood drawn by (unfortunately many GPs are just not good at finding veins).

Because of Dr Loke's thoroughness and him being the preferred doctor of many, it is common for the queue to be 1 hour long. It's usually fine to step away for a while after taking the queue number.

I consulted Dr Loke regularly from early 2021 till end 2023 when I moved house. The receptionists were kind and nice to me.

Dr. Loke himself provided exceptional care. His expertise, professionalism, and genuine concern for my well-being were evident throughout the appointment. He took the time to listen attentively to my concerns, thoroughly explained diagnoses and treatment options, and made me feel comfortable asking questions.

Moreover, the clinic's facilities were modern and well-maintained, contributing to an overall positive experience. The entire team, from the administrative staff to the medical professionals, demonstrated a commitment to patient care that truly set them apart.

I fundamentally believe if you don't like your job you should either quit or do something about it and not vent it on the business's customers. Either the owners is oblivious to the situation or the staffs are putting up a front.

Staff wasnt patient at all when we asked about the ingredients displayed as there were no descriptions and it's our virgin visit. Asked for napkins if possible upon checkout and all 3 front staff quickly jumped on aggressively to say don't have, saw tissues at the cashier counter and asked if I could have one if not I could buy it and they said that's kitchen towels and not tissues so no. After seating down heard the staff complaining among themselves of how they haven't had their off days. I guess they are overwhelmed as they were are seating inside the counter on a toilet stool when we walked in. The place was empty tho with only 1 table of 2pax.

Food was good and super value for money as recommended by a fellow alumni. I personally feel it's underpriced for the quality.

To the owners I hope you're seeing this as you have a great business given your NTU story, and it will be a waste if you lose customers over stupid unnecessary things like this. Super great fast service business model with exceptional prices and the last key to the lock is to have basic decent human to human respect from the service staffs.

I'm not going to dock points, but there are some ingredients I feel are pretty rough and just don't fit in terms of flavour and texture, like the fishcake looking tofu has a grainy feel and is almost flavourless. Other than that, choose between savoury or sweet and sour sauces to complete your bowl. Oh, and their scrambled egg is top notch, extremely creamy, soft and fluffy if you're an egg fan.

Waterway Point,"Waterway Point has always been one of those malls that feels both spacious and lively at the same time. Located right next to Punggol Waterway Park, it’s got that rare combination of shopping convenience and scenic vibes — you can literally finish a coffee and be strolling by the water in under five minutes.

The mall itself is bright, airy, and well laid out, with a good mix of retail, dining, and lifestyle options. Whether you’re here for groceries, a quick meal, or a movie, everything is within easy reach. Dining choices range from casual cafes to family restaurants, and there’s even a decent variety of dessert spots for that after-meal treat. I especially like how there are plenty of seating areas, making it easy to take a breather between shops.

What’s really nice is the way Waterway Point integrates with its surroundings — the outdoor boardwalk and park connectors make it feel less like a concrete mall and more like part of the community. On weekends, you’ll see families with kids playing in the open areas, joggers passing through, and couples taking in the riverside sunset.

All in all, it’s not just a shopping destination but a place to unwind, hang out, and enjoy the Punggol waterfront. Whether you’re here to shop, eat, or just soak in the relaxing atmosphere, Waterway Point delivers a complete day-out experience.",http://www.waterwaypoint.com.sg/,83 Punggol Central,Shopping mall,0,0,0.0,0.025,3,Irrelevant

We sat outside luckily today's weather was quite cool.
German pork knuckle was clearly a highlight; came with mustard, chilli paste, apple sauce, black pepper sauce, and a serving of bread (baguette slices). Will order again. German pork knuckle is this standard is hard to come by although not all pieces of crackling were chewable, but this was probably the exception about one or two pieces. Most of the crackling were truly delectable. Meat did not taste as if it had been parboiled before roasting. Sauerkraut mildly sour. Order this first - takes 30 min at least before you continue with the other orders. Best to tell them to serve dishes together otherwise one or the other may be pretty filled up with the other dishes and waiting for this to be served.
Oxtail stew pretty well-flavoured 2 large pieces, quite meaty and came with a serving of rice.
Shepherd's pie - pretty good taste, portion for one.
Pork collar was pretty good, had bite and not tough. Whole baked potato.
We shared dishes trying to give everyone each a taste of everything.
Attentive and cheerful service.

I ordered their chicken and pork set which was just *chefs kiss*. The pork was succulent and not too gamey! The chicken was tender and chewy. Not sure what magic they do to their meat texture here but sooo good! The variety of marinated meats also meant that it didn’t get jelat fast.

The owner was kind enough to help / teach us how to grill and have the meat correctly. Service staff was also very attentive and changed our charred grill almost after every one meat. They are all super friendly :)

This time, I ordered the samgyetang but it did not quite meet my expectations. There wasn’t enough herbal? flavour in the soup. The soup pretty much tasted like plain soup to me.

However, the kimchi pancake was pretty good! Crispy on the outside and there wasn’t excessive batter.

Do order their fried chicken!!! Sooo good! I didn’t order this time bc the portion was too much! Huuuuge! The chicken is super juicy and its juices literally will splash out as u bite into it. Comparable to pizzamaru (if uk how good theirs is)

S Aesthetics Clinic,"I recently visited this clinic for a facial treatment, paying $416 for what I expected to be a premium experience. Unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst facial I’ve ever had.

To begin with, the service fell far below the standards I anticipated for the price. I wasn’t asked to change out of my clothes, which was surprising and uncomfortable. Additionally, the facial bed had visible hair on it, raising concerns about hygiene and attention to detail.

During the treatment, the manual extraction process was extremely painful, and the therapist repeatedly complained about the condition of my skin. While I was aware my skin wasn’t in perfect shape, that’s precisely why I sought professional care. To address the issue, I even opted for an additional treatment at an extra cost of $188, hoping for better results.

However, not only did the facial fail to improve my skin, but it also left my face damaged, with small bumps that persist even after the treatment. Overall, the experience was deeply disappointing, especially given the high cost and the lack of professionalism. I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking quality skincare services.

It didn’t feel pushy or like they were trying to sell me any treatment, which made me feel at ease and gave me space to decide whether I wanted to proceed. I eventually decided to go ahead with the jaw botox. I was given the option to numb the area, and I decided to do it without.

Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,"My first AF gym, and still the best AF gym I've been to. It may not be the biggest but it makes up for it with a wide variety of equipment that ensures you'll have a well rounded workout. The space is clean, and the huge amount of natural lighting makes this a very bright and comfortable space to work out in.

The provision of free towels is something that's spoilt me — now I'm always looking for towels in other gyms. 

And of course, big shout out to the team here at d'Arena. I've yet to go to an outlet with staff that is this friendly and welcoming. They serve with a smile and really makes you feel like they are happy to help, and that you're not a bother. P.s. Colan: long time no see, but miss talking to you. Always makes me feel like I'm catching up with family when you come by to talk to me 

It takes me an hour to get to this gym from home, and I still make time to go down when I can even though there's a few different AF gyms that are closer to me. Hope that tells you what you need to know about this gym

Anytime Fitness D'Arena Jurong,"My initial experience was great. I’ve heard horror stories of members who had issues cancelling their membership with other AF branches and was assured it wouldn’t happen here. I signed up for 18 months and was relatively happy throughout, the people are nice. However, when it came time to cancel my membership, they kept delaying their response and didn’t want to furnish me with the form to confirm the cancellation. I was constantly asked to go down to their gym and asked why I wanted to cancel (when I had already given my reasoning a few times both on text and in person). After much chasing I finally got the cancellation form and was assured that January will be my final billing month.

Today (1st February) my credit card was charged and I am appalled at the service of this gym. I’ve reached out to their team and hope their service recovery will redeem them.

Just to be clear, AF is great if you have no intentions to leave. It’s only problematic when you try to cancel your membership.

My daughter ordered the Cajun Pork Chop, which came with a generous portion of salad and mashed potatoes, and a complimentary iced Coke as part of the student meal. I went for the Baked Haddock Fish Fillet served with sautéed mushrooms in garlic and mashed potatoes.

Their mashed potatoes truly stole the show — ultra smooth, creamy, and buttery. I rarely finish mashed potatoes, but I cleaned the plate this time. A close second would be the sautéed mushrooms, which were packed with flavour and nicely done with minced garlic.

I saw majority of feedback here is good and we find it legit. Quite surprise on some negative feedback. Guess some people have very high expectation. We will always support honest local business.

Will definitely be back again with friends.",https://www.facebook.com/p/i2-The-Woods-Cafe-100023430863884/,26 Jln Kelulut,Cafe,0,0,0.0,0.012345679012345678,3,Irrelevant
Into The Woods Cafe,"Visited this café for dinner and unfortunately, the entire experience was underwhelming and far from what I expected for the price point.

The Teriyaki Chicken Pizza served was clearly a frozen base with some meat simply added on top.
Something I could have made at home with minimal effort.

For the Chicken and Waffle, the waffle tasted like it came straight from the freezer, the chicken had that dry, air-fried texture and the egg was completely bland with no seasoning at all.

The Mushroom Soup was by far the most disappointing dish. It somehow tasted worse than canned soup, with an odd bitter aftertaste that made it hard to finish. The garlic bread was just a hard piece of bread with some garlic bits sprinkled on top. No flavour, no creaminess. Nothing redeeming.

To make matters worse, the prices were on the higher end. For the quality we received, it simply felt like we were being overcharged. I honestly left feeling like I wasted my money and I believe a refund would be fair considering the poor quality of the meal.

Not a place I’ll be returning to or recommending.",https://www.facebook.com/p/i2-The-Woods-Cafe-100023430863884/,26 Jln Kelulut,Cafe,0,0,0.0,0.008130081300813009,3,Irrelevant

 9/10
 Ci Yuan CC
 Expected damage $15-$25

Value for money and no service charge. This place has been around for a long time and their serving is huge for their prices. My personal recommendation is their mentaiko pasta with the fried chicken. The sauce makes the pasta very savoury which goes well with the crispy chicken. Wanted to try their soft shell crab mentaiko pasta but they only serve it at the upper thompson branch.

The mentaiko Mac N' Cheese is very decadent due to the heaping amount of cheese which caters to many young cheese lovers. Fried chicken and waffle was good and a go-to for those craving a sweet and savoury meal once in a while.

The dessert - devils chocolate cake, is the icing on the cake as it was so thick and sinful. When paired with the ice cream, you are guaranteed to be seeing a doctor soon which is the job of a good dessert.

Kebun Baru Community Club,"My child went for class last Monday and was shot in the right eye at close range by one of the classmates using a solid rubber ball. She cried non stop when in the class and continued crying the whole night. She was very traumatised and fear going back to the class. We have stopped the class for her. We went to the doctor thrice in the past week.
The teacher didn’t even ask the parent of the culprit (a boy who is notorious in the class) to stay behind after class to speak to us. This is unacceptable.
We understand that this matter has been reported to KBCC but after one week- nobody has bothered to reach out to us to even follow up and see whether we need any assistance. Either they are too busy or such accidents happen so often that there’s no cause for alarm even when children’s eyes are injured while attending classes at this CC.

Woodlands Galaxy Community Club,"Visited the badminton courts at Woodlands Galaxy Community Club on 5 April (7:30–9:30 PM) and had a terrible experience. There is a female Indian staff member (likely a cleaner or facility attendant) who was extremely rude and aggressive throughout our session.

She was yelling at everyone in a loud and hostile tone, accusing us of placing items around the court that we didn’t even touch. Her behavior was completely uncalled for and made the environment feel tense and unwelcoming. To make things worse, she shouted at us to leave two minutes before our session officially ended, just so she could close up early. We paid for the court and expected to use it peacefully till the end, not to be rushed and yelled at.

This is supposed to be a community facility for everyone – children, the elderly, and families – to enjoy an active lifestyle in a safe and friendly space. Instead, we were made to feel like a nuisance.

Honestly, not a conducive or welcoming place at all if this is how patrons are treated. Proper staff training is clearly lacking here. I’ll also be raising this to relevant channels because our community deserves better – at the very least, some basic respect and professionalism from staff.",,31 Woodlands Ave 6,Community center,0,0,0.0,0.020689655172413793,3,Irrelevant

We approached her politely to ask for information about an upcoming award ceremony. Instead of offering any assistance, she grumpily told us she didn’t know, her manager wasn’t around, and she couldn't check anything for us. When we asked about the location, her response was simply “don’t know,” with no effort to help us further.

It's shocking that a community center, which is meant to help residents, has staff members like this who seem to have no interest in doing their job properly. Even the Minister would never treat residents with such disrespect. I truly hope the center takes action to investigate and ensure this staff member doesn’t continue to spoil its reputation. Not the level of service I expected at all.",,31 Woodlands Ave 6,Community center,0,1,0.0,0.016260162601626018,4,Advertisement

Booking was from 8pm to 10pm. 930pm the uncle start to chase us off saying last game. We see the uncle was old and try to finish up our game ASAP but he start to say ""HELLO, I ALREADY SAY LAST BALL RIGHT?""

Didn't wanted to argue or quarrel with the uncle. We start packing up and changing our shoes but the uncle just stand at the stage waiting to turn off the lights.

I didn't mean that we are supposed to play till 10pm but I am sure the uncle attitude could have been much better. Simply say 不要已老卖老.

F45 Jurong West,"刚结束完健身，来给F45一个评价，这是我第20次课了，所以才来给一个负责任的点评

整体：5星好评，强烈推荐！！
先讲下我个人情况，我有断断续续2年健身史，有骨盆前倾，有脊柱侧弯， 尝试过BFT，尝试过私教，尝试过普拉提，这家F45是目前很满意的！

具体说下：
教练：
这一点我很看重！这里的3个教练都很Nice尤其是Dhyaanesh, 不会像有的私教课续完了就心不在焉。每节课教练都会很积极的观察每一个学员，我某个动作做着困难腰疼，他会主动过来教我一个适合我的动作变式，有的学员有氧很累蹲地下休息，他会过来问询，给拿糖果防止低血糖，能记住每个学员有什么禁忌和伤病，在相应的动作时作出提醒，防止受伤！
我个人觉得在教练这一块子做的真的非常好！甩大部分团体类健身一条街！（我第一次去BFT做阻力训练……都是30KG的重量…地下有20的片……也没人关心你能不能推……我连换都换不动……干看着……就真的很离谱）

位置：
在比较西边了，但是很便利，楼下一个食阁一个shengsiong, 健身完了买点菜就很顺手～

设备：
基本上该有的都有了，不算特别新，但我觉得够用了，每节课的设置都不一样，有有氧，有阻力，有Hybrid，配合大器械，小器械和一些自重训练，反正每天不会重样，不会腻歪！

总结下我觉得很好的形式，很用心负责的教练，你只需要负责过去，剩下的就跟着节奏来，教练会指导也会鼓励，一闭眼就结束了～～对于我一个弱鸡来讲效果不错，我现在也是一个壮起来的人了！到了需要重新买运动装备的程度哈哈！",https://f45training.com/jurongwest,"7 Jurong West Ave 5, #02-05",Gym,0,0,0.0,0.0,3,Irrelevant

F45 Jurong West,"Thankful for the season at F45 Jurong West. My spouse and I are very grateful for the patience coaching by Founder/Coach Dhyaanesh, Coach Aziz, Coach Jay etc during our time there. Both of us didn’t have fitness background and starting the fitness journey were intimidating for us but the team of dedicated and experienced Coaches and F45’s thoughtful workout design for strength and cardio made it easy for us to follow through. It’s really fun and motivating that the classes change every 4 weeks. You never have to worry of getting bored. We were usually at the morning 7.15am and the evening 7.15pm or 8.15pm classes. We enjoyed the quietness of morning and the busyness of evening classes. The clean shower room was important for me when I attended the morning classes before work and the best part is it’s usually unoccupied.

While we decided to pause our fitness journey with F45 fitness this season due to my spouse’s work schedule, we would love to be back in near future.

Highly recommended for you if you’re on the verge of making a decision. You can try them for 2 weeks trial first.

Pro-tips :
1) Don’t stop after 1 session, push through the sessions and your aches and sores would feel less intensive. For us, we kind of recovered after 3 consecutive days of classes when our muscles adapted.

2) Do what your Coaches told you. We were often in Coach Dhyaanesh and Coach Jay’s classes, they were really helpful to correct us or show us modified workout when they saw us struggling.

3) Ask the Coaches if you’re sure. During one of the busy classes, I remember feeling unsure how I should hold the weight and I was glad I asked Coach Aziz. It was important for me I picked up the right habits.

4) Go slow and focus on form when you’re new. We are glad we learnt our foundation from them.

Thank you, Coach Dhyaanesh and F45 Jurong West!

F45 Jurong West,"Pricing was definitely a big consideration factor at first but after going to the classes for a month, the value definitely comes from having a room full of equipment set up according to the day's planned workout. So all we gotta do is to make sure we turn up, get a good sweat and get out of there. And the exercises are different every day, so there is a good mix up to keep us guessing and scare before our next session. 

Can we do HIIT ourselves? We could but it is more fun with more variations that include kettlebells, bar bells, rowing machines and exercise balls. 

4 weeks into our F45 Challenge and I am glad to have started this journey with my buddy.

He is strong and consistent. Always pushing me hard and encouraging me in our sessions. The coaches as well. While they are not those hellish trainers from BMT, they do challenge you and the onus is on us to take their souls David Goggins' style and push through.

Whatever they served is absolutely restaurant standard, from the Crockery to the food quality and the arrangement. I am sure from the first close look at the food, many will believe that it must be a restaurant.

Taste wise, absolutely hit the mark - Restaurant standard. The portion is also very generous and it is rather affordable too.

Had ordered pork n chicken katsu set that came salad n soup.  Added one side dish of 2 pieces of fried ebi.  Cost almost $33.

Rather pricy for a coffee shop set up but food is of reasonable quality.  Someone reviewed as same as Ma Maison (MM).  Really?

I tapau tonkatsu from MM in JB.  The food is still excellent after 1.5 hours of commuting back to Singapore.  Food stand for that long n still taste good.  That's quality of the food at MM southkey mid valley JB.

Only a short wait at this stall and collected my order in less than 15 mins.  Rather efficient.

Stingy in giving the brown sauce!  I was only given 2 small sauce cups!!  But paid almost $32.  Rather loop sided deal!

May return if I crave for tonkatsu n around this area or don't know what to eat.  Will not be my natural choice to go to this place as the carpark exit did not allow good visibility of cars when trying to filter to the main street.",https://www.facebook.com/Maruhachi2020/,671 Edgefield Plains,Japanese restaurant,0,1,0.1,0.0,4,Advertisement

For $29.90 you get quite a big serving of Oxtail Stew. You can either choose to have it served with rice or baguette. There were 3 pieces of fairly large ox tail, big potato chunks, carrots and whole onion. The ox tail meat was soft and came off the bone easily.

The chicken curry ($15.90) was surprisingly not oily unlike the ones you normally get served with a layer of oil floating on the surface. It did not have the cloying sweetness of a lemak curry. Strong smell of spices reminiscent of Indian curry. Decent pieces of chicken however disappointed that there was only 1 piece of potato the size of a 50 cents coin.",https://www.jacobscafe.com.sg/,"5 Changi Village Rd, #01-2049",Cafe,0,0,0.0,0.0,3,Irrelevant

The server will never make eye contact with dinners and oblivious to their needs, impossible to get her attention until i have to raise my voice and walk up to her this evening on Vesak Day.

After more than 15 mins,  I have to walk up to the counter to get her attention.

Cafe was quiet and tables were either studying or having group chats. place is very instragamable. It become more crowded after 3 plus.

Minimum staff interaction which was ordering at counter and being served the food only.

Ordered honey glazed wings, Hawaiian pizza and smoked salmon waffles. Drinks called are latte and hot chocolate. Food was prepared very quickly. Food tasted great and for the portion ordered is just nice. Latte could have done with more milk in my view.

I didn't experience any bad food or service and will revisit again. A last feedback is perhaps to look to change the cushions as some are very stained. Recommended.",https://www.facebook.com/p/i2-The-Woods-Cafe-100023430863884/,26 Jln Kelulut,Cafe,0,0,0.0,0.017857142857142856,3,Irrelevant

I came in as I booked a vaccine appointment with this clinic the elderly staff Rudely told me to do the declaration form as I presented my IC, the staff didn’t even ask why I am there instead took my ic and told me to seat down.

After I received my 4th booster vaccine, the elderly staff rudely gave me the acknowledgment slip and asked me to go off in a rude manner.

I don’t know whether this staff is having a bad day at work or what but this is not the way to behave toward the patient. I even wonder if this staff is given proper training to learn how to attend to patients especially elderly patients because some of them aren't familiar with the technology.

These staff should be laid off from their job if they aren't happy with their current job because patients are paying their salaries to begin in the first place.

Spent $20k within a year in Suntec but in the end was received this type of treatment. Really disappointed with their team. I hope the 'sudden investigation' were conducted to every Suntec member and not just to a selected/targeted ""members"". (Maybe i got $400+ worth of points)

They serve the drinks: a bottle of beer without open it for customers just leave the opener on the table. Must be fair previous times they got open and leave the bottle on the table…. I wish i can meet the manager or the owner and tell them if you really put intention to build this business then please at least train your staffs.

Tried a variety of dishes for dinner. They have a good spread of options, and the flavours striking in a way that speaks to their authenticity while being affordable.

Their dishes were great. The standout was the steamed sea bass, the fish was fresh, the texture was delicate but robust. Their vegetables were well seasoned, with stir fried beans crisp and flavourful. The egg and tomato was a simple dish but was no less satisfying.

Their food also did not shy away in the spice area, with the heat making a balanced roundness to the dishes without being overpowering. For those not well acquainted with spice, I’m sure they are amenable to requests to taper the kick. Though I do recommend it for the experience.

Service was prompt and attentive, complementing the dishes served. Would come again. They also have private rooms with KTV systems.",,"511 Upper Jurong Rd, B-01-01 Arena Country Club",Restaurant,0,0,0.0,0.0,3,Irrelevant

Overall: 5/5

I recently visited the Uniqlo store at Waterway Point (83 Punggol Central, #01-21, Singapore 828761) and had a fantastic shopping experience. I was particularly pleased with the selection of Heattech items. I picked up a navy blue Heattech Cotton Crew Neck T-Shirt, an off-white Heattech Cotton Crew Neck T-Shirt, and a pair of black Washable Knit Ribbed Pants (Co-ord) (Regular Length).  The quality of the Heattech is, as always, excellent, and the pants are incredibly comfortable.

The service I received from Shyaf and Azrinah was exceptional. Azrinah was especially patient and helpful, offering valuable style advice as I tried on different items.  Her assistance made my shopping experience much more enjoyable.

Told him I only asked to exchange size, not returning/refund, or exchange model. Eventhough the receipt was shown in his device but still he didn't even care how I explained it, he simply said it is system requires to have the original receipt.

Mamana Kitchen,"Bought a rainbow cookie for $5.50. When paying, was surprised to see it was $6. When enquired, I was told the extra $0.50 was due to the single takeaway paper bag. I was surprised and said I would rather take the cookie by hand to avoid this charge. There was no obvious sign that $0.50 would be charged and in any case $0.50 for a single paper bag is really too much.

I ordered some lemon tea and egg and waffles for breakfast and the lemon tea was sour BUT there was sugar syrup so I could make it sweet which is how I like it. The egg and waffles however were amazing. The egg was the weakest part but it was still rich and tasty, the waffles however were amazingly crunchy and the honey they provided supplemented this fact more. The cherry on top was the crunchy greens which were just nice with the sauce they used. The workers were cool and the place was well air conditioned and well cleaned with a toilet to add.

Mamana Kitchen,"I had a bad experience at Mamana Kitchen. While me, my son and my sister were dining in to try their breakfast menu, my son accidentally broke the table’s QR code. I informed and offered to pay for the damage when the lady (i assumed was the owner) served our food. However, HALFWAY through our meal, she accused my son of breaking it again, saying that her staff recognized my son and that he already broke it before which is untrue, as we hadn’t visited in over a month and QR codes weren’t even used then.

She insisted it was him despite our explanation, and gave a rude “warning” not to let it happen again. She also said the boy who broke it was at the outdoor seating, with only my son and my husband around. I asked my husband and he said there had been no such incident. She even told us that she would like us to visit again, so although he “broke” twice, we should be more vigilant. The way she gave a smirk, and insisted in her mind that it was my son without checking the cctv or to show any evidence made me extremely furious. When the owner left, I confronted the staff, she mentioned the incident she referred to happened INDOORS, and that clearly telling us that it wasn’t my son as our last visit, they haven’t introduced the QR code yet. The staff immediately apologized. She was helpful, and very apologetic and I was very thankful of that.

Being falsely accused like that, especially mid-meal, was upsetting and unprofessional. I didn’t even get to finish the food as I had no appetite after we got falsely accused. We definitely won’t be returning. Please review your evidence before making such accusations.",http://mamanakitchen.com/,"231A Sumang Ln, #01-04",Cafe,0,1,0.0,0.005649717514124294,4,Advertisement

The meat was tender which paired well with the creamy onsen egg on bluepea rice and salad. The indoor dinning space has limited seats. So it’s rather cozy.

Anna's,"Spent $90 of my precious CDC vouchers on mid food when I could've eaten at the food court and ended up MORE SATISFIED.

Upon ordering, drinks came after 10 mins of waiting. The beef ragu took ard 20 mins. And the Steak and Fries took a whopping 30 MINS WOW. Even more wonderful that it was thin and not flavourful. We had to flag down the waiter to ask for the brownie dessert but he kept ignoring us  took abt 10 tries to get his attention, and in the end, another waiter helped get the brownie for us.

Notes on the dishes:
Steak was thin. The sambal served with the steak was odd. It was weird with the sourdough and it was weird with the steak. Didn't know what to do with it. Beef ragu was okay. Drinks were okay. Brownie was about the size of my palm.

Total bill came to more than $90. Anna's Beef Ragu ($28), Hibiscus Bliss Frizz ($7), Orange Lychee Cooler ($8), Anna's Steak and Fries (medium, $28), Mochi Brownie with Sea Salt and Olive Oil (serve later, $6.33)

Deeply concern & disappointed towards their poor quality of utensils used. The bowl used for my child's spaghetti from the kids meal — was in extremely poor condition!

Look at the attached image - it was so badly scratched that I was genuinely alarmed. Scratched plastic, especially when used to serve hot food, can leach harmful chemicals into the meal. This is particularly worrying given that this bowl was clearly intended for children.

As a proud Singaporean dining in one of our most established tourist attractions, I expect cafés to uphold the highest standards of hygiene & safety, especially when serving meals to young children! The use of such degraded and potentially hazardous tableware is absolutely unacceptable.

Hits: the curry fish head, sambal lala and dual method kailan were great. cereal prawns were good too but note that it is shelled. The sauces paired well with rice.

Misses: the tom yam soup was way too salty to the point that is barely edible.

Service: food came relatively fast. Order by QR and pay at counter.

Price: Just about what I expected for zichar.

Atmosphere: the indoor seating is very well air conditioned. The outdoor seating is decently cooled by fan, and you can see cooks preparing otah. However, expect insects flying around and on the table as it is within the Park after all.

KidsHealth Paediatric Clinic,"Multiple visits here for the past 4 years, being a mom of 3.

Doctor has always been helpful, detailed and patient dealing with queries and cranky children. Medicines works as intended and so far I do not have any experience of follow-up visit because child was still unwell, thankful for that.

Nurses/counter staff, in my experience, have been great. Gentle with my girls, and kind but some doesn't look as approachable. Not an issue though.

The queueing system, however, has not changed for the past few years. Snaking queues, long waiting hours; I had to be ""kiasu"" enough to reach as early as 7:30am to ""chope"" my place just to avoid +++ waiting time. Once, we were third in line but had to make way for appointment basis visit, followed by 2 others which took more than an hour to wait (from opening time) — with sick cranky kids it's a chore.

Previously during covid days, the nurses were quite strict on number of people waiting in the clinic (which to me was good honestly given the small space); but on my recent visit, most of the them were waiting inside. It gets a little chaotic though with all the sick, crying kids and tight space. There's some toys prepared for the kids too.

Payable by CDA. Not sure what other payment method accepted.

On better days, I get to have breakfast nearby first while waiting; the nurse will give a call when you're 3rd in line so there's ample time to head back.

I'd recommend for non urgent visits; and if you have more time to spare. Otherwise, GP/polyclinic may be a better option.

Despite all these, my number one choice will still be the GP right across my block for convenience (though we've had 2nd visit issues cause of unsuitable meds). Its much cheaper too.

KidsHealth Paediatric Clinic,"We visited Dr Goh because our 6 month old still had phlegm after catching a cold almost 3 weeks ago.

Similar to most paediatric clinics that we've visited, KidsHealth accepts appointments and limits walk-ins. They were also very clear that the wait for walk-ins might be 1-2hrs. This was acceptable for us as we have not seen any paediatric clinics with little or no waiting required for walk-ins.

We were thankful for the coffeeshop that allowed us to wait for 2hrs with a full tummy.

That simple, precautionary step turned out to be life-changing. The ECG revealed clogged arteries, and even the hospital doctors later remarked how lucky it was we came in when we did—just in time to prevent what could have been a major heart attack.

I trust Dr Chuang because he goes about his profession with the same beliefs I hold dear to. I am trained to uncover the root cause as an engineer, before designing a solution. As an experienced HR practitioner, I do not prescribe approaches that address symptoms. One easy but wrong way is to throw training at an employee when the harder right is to give him or her the unpleasant but truthful feedback. Few want and dare to do what’s necessary to help others.

I once asked Dr Chuang why he chose to be a GP when he is a world renowned specialist. He told me he injured his hand and could no longer be a surgeon. He is different from many doctors so many will see him as unorthodox and think he’s wrong when he’s not.

My wife got the significant and sustained treatment we were looking for. Hope you have a clearer idea of how I see Dr Chuang now.",,853 Jurong West Street 81,Medical clinic,0,0,0.0,0.007194244604316547,3,Irrelevant

Richton Cafe Pte Ltd,"Richton Café is a hidden gem conveniently located below an HDB block in Pasir Ris, making it a great spot for a quick and satisfying lunch fix. The café offers an impressive variety of affordable and reasonably priced dishes, catering to different cravings. Whether you’re in the mood for Mee Goreng, Chicken Cutlet Rice, Hongkong Mee, Hor Fun, Mui Fun, Popcorn Chicken, Yong Tau Foo, Fried Bee Hoon, or Kway Teow, there’s always something to choose from.

One of the highlights of this café is its indoor air-conditioned dining area, which provides a comfortable escape from the heat. However, seating is quite limited, especially during weekday lunch hours, so it’s best to come early or be prepared for a short wait. Despite the crowd, the service is efficient, and orders are usually prepared quite fast, making it a convenient option for those on a tight schedule.

A standout for me is their sambal chili—flavorful with just the right amount of spice, enhancing many of their dishes perfectly. It’s the kind of place that serves no-frills, hearty meals, ideal for a casual and fuss-free lunch.

If you’re in the Pasir Ris area and looking for a budget-friendly, tasty, and quick meal, Richton Café is definitely worth a visit!

Uncle Joshua served my breakfast on 27Dec morning. He’s humorous, kind and attentive! Just what patients need when they are down and in recovery- humor brings laughter! Thank you for asking if we needed more hot drinks even after we had our breakfast.

Another be-spectacled basic care assistant wasn’t that nice - the meals I would say: delicious but the serving portions are too little. So I’ve asked for 2 packets of crackers and a Milo- the auntie passed by the nurse counter and said aloud: usually we don’t give right after meals you know?! Hello, not your crackers and Milo and I am the patient leh, I cannot ask for more food if I’m still hungry meh?

National Cancer Centre Singapore,"Don’t tell people to put wheelchair outside hallway for public use when they still need it. You know how hard it is to find another in the other floors beside entrance? If the patients need the wheelchair they would’ve got the chair before they entered.

I visited the hospital with my grandma today and when she went in for her treatment, I waited for her outside and decided to wheel the empty wheelchair to an area with seat.

An older nurse stop me and ask that I placed the wheel chair outside. I said my grandma still wants to use the wheel chair as she’ll only be inside for a short while, but she still insisted I put it outside so everyone can use.

Can you for the love of god use your head and understand the reason why it’s a dumb idea to ask patient to put wheel chair outside the hallway? There is literally no wheelchair outside especially when there is a lot of visitors. Why do you think all of us are bringing the wheelchair with us whenever we go?

If I put it outside “for someone to use” and they take the wheel chair, I need to go all the way to the ground floor because that’s the only place I know where to get wheel chair. If my grandmother alone came here, she put out then how? Can’t find the wheel chair and ask her go all the way first floor to get?? If my grandfather came instead, he need go all the way to the first floor. You only want young people to accompany patient is it?

Trouble another nurse to get wheelchair all the way from first floor? I’m sure they don’t exactly know where to find wheel chairs either in the other floor. It’s near impossible because I also had to find wheelchair in the other floor before.

You know I’m honestly applaud and offended, like if this was my grandmother I don’t think she even knows where to find the wheel chair after she put outside. And is it even necessary to tell us this? If you have limited wheelchairs I understand, but I visited the hospital and there are numerous wheelchairs outside the entrance ground floor. It comes off as a little too insensitive and stuck up. Also why am I the only one who was told this?? She never even tell the other older visitors who are accompanying the patient. When my mother came to me she immediately stop what she said and left?? Just because I’m a young person doesn’t mean I won’t put up a bad review or complaint.",https://www.nccs.com.sg/,30 Hospital Boulevard,Medical Center,0,0,0.0,0.004975124378109453,3,Irrelevant

As a medical professional myself, I can genuinely say that meeting Dr. David, my father’s oncologist at Singapore National Cancer Centre (NCCS), has been one of the most inspiring experiences in this journey.

From the very first appointment, I could see his depth of knowledge, professionalism, and compassion. His clinical judgment is exceptional — calm, clear, and deeply reassuring. I’ve learned so much just by being in the room with him during my father’s visits.

Despite being told in Dubai that my father might have a new cancer, Dr. David’s expertise helped reveal that this was not the case. His careful review and insight proved that the earlier findings were incorrect — and for that, my entire family is deeply grateful. I’m truly happy I traveled all the way from Dubai for this opinion and treatment. It was absolutely worth it.

I also want to thank Dr. Brian, my father’s surgeon at Singapore General Hospital, for his excellent care and support throughout this process.

National Cancer Centre Singapore,"I am truly grateful for the excellent care provided by the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS). From the very start, the process has been structured and well-organized. Everything, from making appointments to registration, medication prescriptions, and treatment, is handled efficiently.

The orientation for newcomers is very helpful, and I appreciate the thoughtful details like offering home delivery for medication at no extra charge. NCCS also provides comprehensive cancer support services, including call and clinic support for managing side effects and mental health advice, which has been incredibly valuable throughout the treatment journey.

The nursing team here provides exceptional support that, in many instances, can be better than what one might experience with private specialists. Their dedication and professionalism truly stand out. Though not all hospitals are perfect, NCCS does their best in ensuring patients feel supported and cared for. They also encourage continuous improvement by asking for online feedback after every visit.

Even though mask requirements have been lifted, I still wear one to protect myself, especially when there's news about flu bugs. The accessibility of the center is also a plus—it's a short walk to the SGH cafeteria, which is handy when the café on Level 2 is crowded or when I prefer other food options.

I want to extend my heartfelt thanks to the oncologists, pharmacists, and nurses who have cared for me throughout this year. Your dedication and expertise make all the difference.",https://www.nccs.com.sg/,30 Hospital Boulevard,Medical Center,0,1,0.0,0.023529411764705882,4,Advertisement

Acupuncture has been quite effective for me so far in relieving of my cramps and reducing blood clots, but I believe consistency is key to maintaining its effectiveness.

Am grateful most of all to have found an empathetic, personable, kind, caring, patient and helpful doctor who has always made me feel comfortable and at ease when sharing somewhat private details of my health issues, to best receive the most appropriate line of medical treatment. Dr Zhao is also professional and appears humble despite her seniority in the TCM field over years of experience. This makes me look forward to each consultation and treatment session with her, knowing I’m in good hands.

My sister had a deep cut wound, and the nurse was kind enough to let her see the doctor quickly. But Dr. Andrew barely looked at her injury, didn’t examine it properly, and impatiently wrapped it with brown dressing—so tightly that her finger turned purple.

He dismissed it as minor, saying it would heal in a week. Thankfully, my parents didn’t feel right and took her to A&E. There, the hospital doctor said the wound was deep enough to see the bone, required an X-ray and five stitches, and even commented that the dressing used at the clinic is no longer recommended.

Central 24-Hr Clinic (Jurong West / Pioneer North) - CHAS | GP Clinic | 24 小时 诊所,"Im leaving this feedback to express my dissatisfaction with the service I received at the clinic.

I visited the clinic with my husband and we registered at 6.15 PM. The lady counter staff informed us that the doctor would start seeing patients at 6.30 PM. My husband was running a fever and feeling very unwell, so we politely asked if we could sit on the waiting chairs while waiting just 15 more minutes? However, the lady counter staff firmly replied, ""No.""
I was shocked by the lack of empathy and professionalism. Is this really how you treat patients who are clearly unwell and in need of care? It’s not just about policy,  its about basic humanity pls.

Moreover, the waiting time was excessively long. Even after the doctor started at 6.30 PM, we were still waiting as patient number 5 at 7.30 PM, while patient number 4 was still inside with the doctor.

I sincerely hope the clinic takes this feedback seriously and makes an effort to improve both the attitude of the front-desk staff and the efficiency of your services. Patients come to a clinic for help — not to be treated coldly and made to wait in discomfort. There are already many negative reviews about this clinic, and I now understand why. I believe others had similar real experiences like ours.

Healthway Medical (Jurong West),"Went to this clinic out of the usual family clinic i always visited since i was a baby due to extreme rashes from my body. The usual clinic is too packed and need advance booking. Decided to go forward with a faster alternative instead.

Doctor took a torchlight to look at my rashes and insist that he wanted me to take off my shorts (with undies on), calling in with a female assistant to look at my rash on my buttock area. Just FYI - I have rash all over my body. Including outer thighs, arms, elbows. Of all places he wants to see those that were inside clothing. Asked questions that seemed grey “do i always wear this type of undies” - could be checking if i am allergic to cloth material. Pulling my undies a little near to my middle to see rashes. And also pulling up my top a little to see my back if there were rashes before i could allow him to. Asked a few inappropriate questions. Without thinking much i answered all his questions.

Gist of the story: he diagnosed was that i am infested with mites/ lice called scabies. He prescribed a few low dosage itch pills to stop the itch. But was ineffective. Gave me a prescription to go to the local pharmacy to get a lotion for lice & mites treatment. To be applied from neck to the feet for 3 days.

Today: I visited my usual GP and she said it was just heat rash & eczema flaring up from the hot weather. If it was lice/ mites with that lotion it would’ve already stopped itching and cleared up already. Spent a total of $57.35 + $15 for lotion. The medication was also deemed ineffective due to the low dosage. Not showing any effects of relieving itch too.

Doctor asked me twice about if i needed an Mc. I said no. He proceeded to ask me what do i work as (not needed to answer actually). Yes i do not need an MC but i need to cure my rashes and itch. It seemed like this clinic is just good at giving MC for people who tend to chao geng but not for serious health matters. If a much accurate diagnosis of my rash could be given i wouldn’t be going to another round to the doctor again.

The best part came. When reached 10 am, only reached no. 7. I was starved badly and I gave up my blood test. I went to ask for my medicine instead. Waiting until 10.15 am, my medicine still not prepared. Then I went for my breakfast because seriously cannot taban already. After I back from my breakfast around 10.30 am, the q no. was only 10. Then the doctor saw my request for medicine. She refused to give the medicine just like that and asked the nurse to take my blood pressure and until I met her in her room by cutting the q. After a short consultation, I left the clinic at 11.30 am and it has not reached no. 17.

Just think about I need to starve to do the blood test. If follow today's time, I need to wait until at least 12 pm. I will be starving for my breakfast and lunch and DO NOTHING but just wait there. I don't understand why took so long for a patient to do the blood test and how come the q no so slow.

Another little disappointment due to not having vanilla as the classic milkshake choice of most restaurants with milkshakes.

When the carbonara was served, it was served with a thumb touching the gravy / sauce that was on the edge of plate but linked with rest of the food inside the plate.

Rise & Grind Coffee Co.,"Rise & Grind Coffee Co.: A Promising Spot for Business Lunch with Room for Refinement

I chose Rise & Grind Coffee Co. for a recent business lunch, drawn by its reputation as a comfortable cafe. The setting was certainly pleasant, offering a relaxed and suitable environment for a midday meeting.

For my meal, I ordered the Pork Chop with Black Pepper Sauce. I must commend the kitchen on the marinade, which was clearly well-executed and delivered good flavour. However, I found the pork chop itself to be overcooked, resulting in a texture that was a little too tough. The long black I had was decent, serving its purpose as a coffee but not particularly standing out in its flavour profile.

In terms of service, it was okay. I noticed that a few tables required prompting before the crew came over to clean them, which felt a bit less proactive than I would have liked. On a prior note, the booking experience was not as smooth as it could have been, with the payment gateway presenting a bit of a challenge.

While the food and service were acceptable, there are certainly areas for improvement. A more attentive approach to table maintenance and a smoother booking process would enhance the overall experience. The pork chop has great potential, and with a little more care in the cooking, it could be a truly excellent dish.

Overall, Rise & Grind Coffee Co. is a fine choice for a casual business lunch due to its atmosphere. However, I hope they can refine their operational processes and consistency in the kitchen to better match their comfortable setting.",http://www.riseandgrind.co/,"681 Punggol Dr., #01-06 Oasis Terraces",Restaurant,0,1,0.0,0.024691358024691357,4,Advertisement

The Apricus Coffee & Food Co.,"I think this is one of the more well-known cafés in the area. The atmosphere is great — very family-friendly, especially with the playground for kids. I’d say it’s a solid four-star café overall, but I’m giving five stars today to support them, as my dinner experience was peaceful and comfortable.

Their salmon pasta always sets me on fire — it’s the main reason I keep coming back! The sauce is creamy, and the salmon is perfectly cooked. I also tried the lamb burger, but it wasn’t really my type… especially the bun. Not sure how to describe it — maybe not fluffy enough? Honestly, even McD’s Angus burger buns might be better (JK!).

Thankfully, I also ordered the truffle cheese fries — not the best I’ve had, but still very tasty, nicely seasoned, and had a good truffle aroma.

We didn’t manage to try the desserts because we were too full from the mains — which shows the portion sizes are quite generous, and pricing feels reasonable.

I noticed other customers sharing one salmon pasta and pairing it with fries or dessert — honestly, that’s a smart way to enjoy more variety without over-ordering.",https://www.instagram.com/theapricuscafe/,248 Jln Kayu,Cafe,0,0,0.0,0.007142857142857143,3,Irrelevant

The Apricus Coffee & Food Co.,"I visited Apricus Coffee during a non-peak period, thinking I could enjoy a cup of coffee while waiting for my friends to arrive. Upon entering, none of the staff greeted me, which was a bit odd given it wasn’t busy. I decided to take a seat at the bar stools near the entrance and cashier. The staff looked occupied, so I didn’t mind the lack of attention at first.

About 5 minutes later, a staff member approached me and asked if I was waiting for a table. I explained that I was waiting for friends and thought I’d have a coffee in the meantime. She then asked if I had a reservation, which caught me off guard—I wasn’t aware one was needed. I replied honestly, saying I didn’t know. She then asked what time my friends would arrive, and when I said around 6:30–7:00pm, she told me there would be a crowd coming at 7pm.

At that point, I felt uncomfortable and slightly offended—was I being indirectly told to leave? I reassured her that I just wanted to have my coffee and would leave before the crowd came. I ended up ordering my coffee and leaving shortly after.

While I understand if there were upcoming reservations, the way it was communicated made the experience feel unwelcoming. A bit more warmth and clarity would’ve gone a long way.

Mariners' Corner Restaurant,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food and value. Our family of 3 had the escargots, seafood stew and tenderloin steak.

The escargots were drenched in garlic butter and each bite was a burst of flavour. My 7 year old son who refused to eat escargots became a convert after trying them. The steak was done to medium rare perfection and we enjoyed every bit of it. The seafood stew was good too but we felt the ingredients could be a bit fresher. The steak was definitely my highlight of the night.

I wish they had draft beer instead of bottled beer, but overall we had a great family meal with nostalgic cosy vibes.",https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Family-Style-Restaurant/Mariners-Corner-Restaurant-164932550195771/,"106 Clementi Street 12, #01-40",Restaurant,0,0,0.0,0.0,3,Irrelevant

Steak was fantastic. They do their medium rare correctly  The meal is very filling and I would’ve been better off without the soup.

Mariners' Corner Restaurant,"Today’s introduction is something different, not our normal hawker/coffeeshop food. We have visited mariners’ corner, located at sunset way.

We have ordered a salmon dish and a thermidor prawns with chicken chop set meal. The set meal also comes with a salad, soup of the day, tea/coffee and dessert.

1st look at the dishes, i must say i quite like the color. I have wasted no time digging in to the greens 1st. Not bad. Then i tried the mash potatoe, quite decent too. Put the prawns to the side, attacked the chicken chop. Wow i must say i am impressed by the chop. Nice and soft. Sauce is really good. Just take note not to wait too long to eat it. Because it taste nice when it’s warm, thereafter when it goes cold, it gets pretty tough.

Salmon is pretty tough to begin with. Personally i didn’t really liked it. Especially when the price is not cheap. Makes me rethink why did we order this dish. Maybe we should have ordered something else. I hope my honest feedback can make you decide which dish to order.

The prawns are not too bad. Not the best ever but decent.

Can go and try if you are near that area. Try the chicken chop

Mariners' Corner Restaurant,"Amazing food, we got the pork chops, grilled lamb chops, BBQ pork ribs and the N.Z ribeye with sausage, all of which were cooked really nicely! The ribs were so tender it was just falling off the bones ‍ great service crew also, tending to us promptly and catering to our needs! A solid 9/10 for meat lovers. Great portion, satisfying flavours, and comforting all around. Would definitely come back for this after a long day or when you’re just craving something hearty and indulgent.",https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Family-Style-Restaurant/Mariners-Corner-Restaurant-164932550195771/,"106 Clementi Street 12, #01-40",Restaurant,0,0,0.0,0.0,3,Irrelevant

Mariners' Corner Restaurant,"Came here for lunch on 11/5/25 (Sun) for lunch without reservation. Happened to be a busy day island-wide as most families are celebrating Mother's Day.

Offered seating alfresco (with shelter from sun/rain). Ox tail stew was nice without overpowering spices. The buttered vegetables a tad bland, may be to better complement the stew.

Topped up $5.80 to 1 order to complete the meal with garlic bread (2 slices), a soup, a salad, a cake for dessert and hot coffee/tea.

The salad was a little lacklustre, in part due to the unusual colour of the dressing. Opined that the ox tail stew as a meal is sufficient unless you are a big eater. Can forgo the soup",https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Family-Style-Restaurant/Mariners-Corner-Restaurant-164932550195771/,"106 Clementi Street 12, #01-40",Restaurant,0,1,0.0,0.0,4,Advertisement

Prime Supermarket,"Used to shop here as it is near, but the price is outrageous sometimes. And now, some items require you to take a photo of the barcode to get an additional discount, You have to show it to the cashier, OTHERWISE YOU WILL BE PAYING EXTRA.

My mum has forgotten about it sometimes because it requires 3 4 photo taking of the barcode. It’s ridiculous.

It shouldn't be the customer's job to take a photo of the barcode just to get a discount.
It’s an outrageously outdated method. Clearly shows the company is sleeping and being lazy.

During the digital migration, it was handled poorly, resulting in some loss of points. It appeared suddenly and there weren’t any plans to push out this migration progressively.

Out of nowhere. A manual membership card wasn’t accepted. You have to download their crappy app (that hang and couldn’t even load properly, doing it at the cashier will just hold up the queue).
You are serving the senior generation. You shouldn't expect the elderly to understand so quickly to migrate their membership digitally or take a photo of the barcode to get an additional discount.

Meridian Medical Centre,"Updated review after clinic’s detailed explanation:
This clinic doesn’t offer subsidised vaccination pricing as per MOH subsidised rate guidelines despite booking via MOH site, so it’s definitely pricier than normal. Based on clinic’s explanation, only selected clinics may offer subsidised vaccination, and some may charge consultation fees. Maximum price for flu vaccine per MOH guidelines is $70 (based on clinic’s explanation) and that was what was charged & paid. Do check before heading over as we’ve had to pay almost 2x the price compared to other clinic. Other clinic only charged my family member $38 btw.

MAJOR REGRET not checking.

Update after seeing Dr Tang’s reply:
We did show Green CHAS card to the staff, but was still told there’s no subsidy at all (only CHAS chronic card is entitled for discount) even though MOH and Vaccine.gov.sg states that with Green CHAS card will be $35. We also booked the flu vaccine appointment via MOH’s website click through, assuming it’ll direct us to clinics under the same pricing scheme but had a rude shock when a nearby clinic from home charged my other family member $38.15 while this clinic charged us $70. Not sure where the discrepancies are or if this clinic just doesn’t offer subsidised rates per MOH’s guidelines. Still unsatisfied as we did not get any clear explanation as to why there are price differences. The staff only mentioned “this is our clinic pricing, only CHAS chronic is entitled to staff discount”.",https://meridianmedical.com.sg/,"108 Depot Rd, #01-10 Depot Heights Shopping Centre",Medical Center,0,1,0.0,0.0,4,Advertisement

Kokoro Izakaya,"Great ambience for japanese Restaurant. Food wise is also good, presentation is also pretty. 

One bad experience is that the Miso soup cover has formed a kind of vacuum and it makes the lid  difficult to open. And when opened , the soup tend to spill / lid fly away. I recommend to change to an easier to open lid, because not only did I experience this opening lid challenge, my colleague also experience similar case. The crew quickly changed new green tea for me when I accidentally bumped and dropped the Drink. Kudos to the great quick Service.

They also have live band every Wednesday and Friday 6.30pm, it's interesting concept for a japanese Restaurant.",,"1 Joo Koon Cir, #01-51 FairPrice Joo Koon",Japanese restaurant,0,0,0.0,0.011904761904761904,3,Irrelevant

Kokoro Izakaya,"I didn’t realize they had a live band, I wasn’t quite prepared to be dining in a noisy loud environment. Food was really average and some below average. Service was so so. I ordered a bottle of Ozeki Umeshu but they ended up serving a different Yuzu bottle instead. Although server came back to inform the one I ordered was out of stock and they’d gladly refund the wrong bottle served to us but it’ll be good if this was done upfront instead ie inform us the one we ordered was outta stock and check if we wish to order some others. The eventual bottle that was served to us didn’t even offer me any buzz even though it showed 14% alcohol on the back of the bottle. Not sure if it was kept too long cos there were definitely some yellow stuff floating on the surface when we poured the drink into a cup.

Fernvale Hawker Centre & Market,"July 2023: Updated July 2025
- Spacious, well ventilated (high ceiling and giant fans), mid-sized hawker center.
- Has a small wet market section with about a dozen stalls.
- Run by the Kopitiam Group.
- Can pay using PayNow/PayLah! QR, cash (getting uncommon), CDC vouchers or the NTUC app. Best using the NTUC app as you get a 10% discount.
- Stalls are not as many as the larger hawker centers, but I think there is enough variety for everyone.
- The biggest plus point is it's clean. The cleaning staff work rather efficiently to clean the floors and the tables. The dirty plates are also moved to the closed washing bay quickly.
- As a result, rarely see birds or pigeons and the hawker center is not littered with bird droppings.

Requested an empty bowl from the shop owner and he only offer a small bowl but bigger one. I asked, can I have a bigger one instead of small. He replied “small bowl is free but the big one is chargeable.” (His face was look down when replied)
I was shocked when he said that and confused why bigger bowl is changeable but the small.

Tried the croffle, but for 10 dollars it is overpriced for a small waffle and not filling. Coffeeshop waffle is bigger than this waffle. The waffle is just okay nothing speical. The ice cream mars chocolate is quite okay though, got chocolate bits.  I think chocolate gelato cup is better worth for half the price instead of adding on waffle, but as other commentors said, the portion size very small.
